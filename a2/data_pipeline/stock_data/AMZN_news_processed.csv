Cover story ""This Bull Market Is Far From Over, Pros Say.

"Cloud, Retail Sales In Focus as Amazon Earnings Near, But Regulatory Concerns Also Loom",2021-04-27 16:38:56+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"At this point, it’s hard to build up much suspense for Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings. That’s in part due to the continued increase in online shopping, strong tailwinds from last year that are anticipated to endure, and because the company helpfully provides guidance for revenue and operating income. Of course, guidance isn’t a guarantee, but the insight can be helpful.
Having said all that, there are plenty of unknowns in the long term. One worrisome thing is how both the public and politicians in the U.S. and overseas are starting to become more verbal about just how, well, “Amazonian” the company has become, raising antitrust and other concerns.
We’ll take a deeper dive into the regulatory picture a bit lower down. For now, let’s look at what kind of quarter investors might expect from this $1.7 trillion company when it reports, an event expected after the close this Thursday.
Another Quarter Of Revenue Increases
Covid provided a big boost to AMZN’s revenue in 2021 as online shopping grew and businesses relied more on the cloud, and that’s expected to remain a supportive factor in the company’s Q1.
As a reminder, in the last three quarters of 2020, AMZN’s earnings exceeded analysts’ expectations by a whopping 606% (Q2), 67% (Q3), and 95% (Q4). In Q4 it delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, generating $125.56 billion in sales. Though Q1 didn’t have a holiday season or Amazon Prime Day, we were still in a pandemic with people continuing to show a preference for online shopping.

FIGURE 1: SIDEARM DELIVERY. Though revenue has trended up for Amazon (AMZN—candlestick), share prices have not—versus the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX—purple line)—over the past 6 months. Data sources: Nasdaq, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock,2021-04-29 11:17:00+00:00,newsfeedback@fool.com (Parkev Tatevosian),The e-commerce retailer gave investors a glimpse of its potential during the pandemic.,investing,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/29/3-reasons-to-buy-amazon-stock/?source=iedfolrf0000001
"With Fed Meeting Out Of Way, Market Eyes Amazon, Facebook Earnings Due Later",2021-04-29 14:05:34+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"Mark Twain once quipped, “Everyone complains about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it.” 
Well, these days everyone probably would complain about inflation if it ever reappeared in a major way, but the Fed promises it won’t do anything about it until employment is on track toward whatever “normal” was before the pandemic. 
As Wall Street analysts expected, the Fed didn’t change rates or make any other policy changes coming out of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that ended this afternoon. Rates stayed near zero, where they’ve been for over a year, and the Fed remains committed to its $120 billion a month bond-buying program designed to keep borrowing costs low and refuel the economy coming out of the pandemic. 
At first blush, this looks like a pretty dovish meeting, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear the Fed isn’t talking about any decline in asset purchases or increase in rates. There were three things investors were curious about going in—asset purchases, rates, and inflation—and Powell was dovish on all of them. 
Treasury yields actually began to fall as the Powell press conference went on this afternoon, with the 10-year yield edging down toward 1.61% to 1.62%. That’s down a few basis points from this morning’s two-week highs. 
There was no change to the Fed’s commitment, outlined last month, to basically stand on the sidelines “for some time” if year-over-year inflation stays “moderately” above what has been the Fed’s long-term goal of 2%. Core inflation, per the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices report, was 1.4% in February, the most recent month tracked. However, consumer prices are already rising more than 2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Optimism Club: Fed Sees Positive Signs For Economy
There were a couple of changes in the Fed’s statement from last time, with the Fed now saying employment has “strengthened.” Arguably, you could see that as an improvement from “turned up” in its March statement. The statement noted some inflation, but again said it’s likely to be “transitory.” March consumer prices rose 2.6%, the highest year-over-increase since August 2018. 
In another change, the Fed’s statement now says sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have “shown improvement.” The public health crisis still weighs on the economy, the Fed said, but no longer on employment or inflation. 
Still, inflation doesn’t seem to be a really big concern now for the Fed, judging from how the statement and press conference went. They seem basically comfortable with inflation staying above 2% for the rest of the year because that will be against very easy comparisons to a year ago, when we had the big slowdown due to Covid. The Fed apparently believes we’ll have to wait until next year to get a reliable sense of what inflation is doing 
The stock market had been mixed earlier Wednesday and stayed that way after the Fed’s decision and as investors waited for Powell to start his press conference. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) actually made up some ground and turned green after the statement. Earnings continue to be solid but the SPX hadn’t really gone anywhere since earnings season started, possibly an indication that a lot of the strength in earnings was already built in. 
Basically, this meeting looks like a placeholder. That means attention could focus more on the big earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) coming up later today, along with the gross domestic product (GDP) report and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings due tomorrow. 
One thing Powell isn’t ready to do is chip around the edges of the Fed’s program to support the economy.

"Earnings Parade Continues With Exxon Mobil, Chevron After Strong Amazon Results",2021-04-30 14:26:06+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"The fatigue we all might feel as this jam-packed week winds down appears to be affecting major indices Friday. They’re under pressure early despite Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) impressive earnings yesterday, with signs of a bit of slowness in China’s economy dragging things lower. 
China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning. Any rally back toward 1.7% or above could grab traders’ attention after the dovish Fed meeting ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",News|Earnings|Commodities|Options|Markets|Tech|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/04/20890262/earnings-parade-continues-with-exxon-mobil-chevron-after-strong-amazon-results

"Shipping Speed, Transparency Continue To Trip Up e-Commerce Brands",2021-05-03 14:49:39+00:00,FreightWaves,"The retail customer journey has been changed forever. No longer is going to a physical store and browsing the aisles the only method of shopping. More browsing than ever is taking place online, more sales than ever are occurring in digital spaces and more pressure on retailers is driving change – and new challenges – that continue to alter the shopping experience.

Understanding these changes are key to creating successful customer journeys. More importantly, though, is understanding what the modern consumer seeks. A series of recent reports provide some insights into the consumer of 2021 and what they say is important to them, giving retailers and brands a road map to fulfilling consumer needs.

The Face Of The Online Consumer

In Jungle Scout's Q1 2021 Consumer Trends Report, consumers reported that free shipping was the top reason to shop online. That jumped up from the fourth spot in the Q4 report, suggesting shipping cost was less of a factor during the busy holiday season. Lower prices, which was sixth in the Q4 report, jumped up to No. 2 in Q1. Convenience was third in Q1 after topping the survey in Q4.

The report, which surveyed 1,005 U.S. consumers Jan. 26-29, 2021, found that 46% of consumers leave items in their online cart and forget about them, suggesting brands have some work to do to convert these customers.

When it comes to which online retailers are most popular, it's no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) topped the list, with 73% of respondents saying they shopped at Amazon.com at least once in the past three months. Amazon was followed by Walmart (NYSE: WMT) at 40%; eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Target (NYSE: TGT), 18% each; and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), 10% each.

When it comes to returns, 31% of respondents said they would return a product bought from an online store. That number increased slightly, to 32% for Amazon shoppers, but both numbers remained below the 37% who said they were likely to return an item at a physical store.

Consumers looking for items often start with Amazon, with 74% of them saying that is their first online stop. Search engines were popular as well, with 65% saying that's where they start researching items. A brand or retailer's website was cited by 38% followed by social networks Facebook, 31%; YouTube, 29%; Instagram, 21%; and TikTok, 10%. (Note: Respondents could select multiple answers.)

When it comes to getting a product in a timely manner, though, the clear choice is Amazon, with 64% saying they turn to Jeff Bezo's platform.

Nearly three-quarters of consumers – 73% – believe the majority of shopping will happen online in the future and 43% said they would be fine if they never shopped in a physical store again. A full 58% of consumers shop online at least once a week if not more.

'Hemispheric Globalization' Could Boost El Paso Trade,2021-05-05 14:42:15+00:00,FreightWaves,"FreightWaves recently chatted with Jon Barela, CEO of the Borderplex Alliance, about the port of El Paso's role in global trade and how the city can continue to capitalize on its location along the United States-Mexico border.

The Borderplex Alliance is an El Paso-based economic development nonprofit. In the past nine months, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), T.J. Maxx Inc. (NYSE: TJX) and Critical Materials Corp. have announced plans for major distribution centers in the far West Texas city.

El Paso cross-border trade struggled during the pandemic, dropping to $29.2 billion during 2020, compared to $76.6 billion in 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The El Paso port of entry also handled only 286,434 commercial trucks in 2020, compared to 792,441 in 2019.

Barela said in the wake of the pandemic he sees more nearshoring opportunities for the Borderplex, a transborder region that includes the cities of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, as well as Las Cruces and Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

This interview was edited for clarity and length.

FREIGHTWAVES: Do you often hear from foreign companies wanting to relocate to the Borderplex?

BARELA: ""We're at a record level of being vetted; people have discovered our region as being a compelling choice for a business expansion and relocation. We are coming off a record year in 2020 in terms of expanding our economic base and job creation [more than 2,000]. We're expecting that trajectory to continue again throughout this year and into the next as we recover from this COVID pandemic.""

FREIGHTWAVES: Can you expand on how much nearshoring the region could see in the future?

BARELA: ""Our trading relationship between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. remains extremely strong. Those clearly are our primary trading partners in our region. But we are experiencing an increased level of reshoring opportunities in our region from China and other parts of Asia. I think that is going to continue for the next year or two; reshoring momentum that has started will not abate in any way. In the short term, or maybe the medium term due to the heightened tensions we have with China, both militarily and through trade, I don't see the Biden administration changing any major policies right now, in terms of their approach in dealing with China.""

The Canadian cannabis giant attributed these results to various expenses, credit losses, lower income tax recoveries, advancements of gross margins and sales reductions.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyst Pablo Zuanic kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on Canopy’s stock, lowering their price target to CA$30.50 from C$32.
Canopy’s quarterly business-to-business sales were stable, and therefore better than its competition and previously provided outlook, explained Zuanic in a Tuesday note.
According to the analyst, good business-to-business sales in the quarter should reveal significantly advanced March shipments, with many other cannabis companies reporting double-digit drops in adult-use shipments for the same period. “So, in that context, these are good numbers.”
Later in the week, Canopy dropped its deal with Canadian rapper Drake. Their partnership was structured around an agreement where Drake would hold a 60% stake in a cannabis brand named More Life Growth Company, while Canopy would control the remaining 40%.
Commenting on the news, Green Market Report’s Debra Borchardt told Benzinga, “Canopy Growth continues to log massive net losses which tend to overshadow the company's revenues. Despite reporting over half a billion in revenues this week, the company's continuing efforts to rightsize and clean up old deals have left a mark. Dropping Drake from the lineup this week wasn't too shocking, but it would be great if Canopy could have a week where it wasn't forced to deliver another negative news headline.""
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
Meanwhile, on Thursday and Friday, Benzinga hosted a new edition of the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference, featuring most of the top names in the industry. Speakers discussed a wide array of topics, from building a $1 billion cannabis supplies company and the road to federal legalization to the CBD beverage market, growing cannabis in hotter climates and multi-billion dollar M&A deals.
And Hempz, a hemp seed oil-based skin and body care brand, named HBO's Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson as its new celebrity ambassador.

What Happened: G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States pledged to enforce a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.
In addition, they committed to ensuring taxes are paid in the countries in which revenues are generated, potentially eliminating the transfer of profits to tax shelters like Ireland.
Why It’s Important: Bank of America analyst Justin Post said the new framework could potentially eliminate digital services taxes in the Eurozone, such as the 3% tax in France.

"Benzinga's Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Apple, Amazon, Biogen, Bitcoin, Tesla And More",2021-06-12 20:20:43+00:00,Nelson Hem,"Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. 
The past week's bullish calls included the e-commerce leader, a top biotech and the airlines.
The iPhone maker, the top cryptocurrency and a COVID-19 vaccine maker were among the bearish calls seen.

The big three U.S. indexes offered mixed signals last week, with the Nasdaq ending almost 2% higher, the S&P 500 up fractionally and the Dow Jones industrials lagging with almost a 1% retreat.
The S&P 500 did manage to eke out a new record high last week, but overall, Wall Street seemed to be in wait and see mode, with speculation that the reopening cycle may have already peaked, former drivers tech and financials still sputtering and ahead of the coming week's FOMC meeting. The Consumer Price Index came in hotter than expected, though the muted market reaction suggests inflation fears may have already been priced in.
Bucking the low volume trend last week were the meme stocks, which offered retail investors another wild ride. In addition, a notable FDA drug approval gave biotech stocks a bit of a boost. Still, some investment firms are anticipating a muted second half of the year for the markets.

EXCLUSIVE: Jan Eeckhout's 'The Profit Paradox' Details How Lack Of Competition Warps Economies,2021-06-13 18:45:35+00:00,Phil Hall,"Boss Tweed, the notorious 19th-century New York City political chieftain, once remarked, “The way to have power is to take it.”
Tweed’s philosophy appears to have survived well into the 21st century, at least according to Jan Eeckhout, author of the new book “The Profit Paradox: How Thriving Firms Threaten the Future of Work.”
In his book, Eeckhout details how a relatively small number of companies have created an off-kilter environment over the past four decades in which they have consolidated economic controls to a point where they can exist without fear of either competition or government regulation. As a result of this situation, workforce wages have mostly stagnated and prices on consumer and industrial goods are in constant ascension.
Eeckhout, who is the ICREA Research Professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and previously taught at the University of Pennsylvania, University College London, Princeton University and New York University, spoke with Benzinga about “The Profit Paradox” and the state of global macroeconomy.
Benzinga: How did you come about with the thesis for your work?
JE: The thesis is based on facts, and we see two things. First of all, with the new fast technological change that's going on, we see that those highly productive firms — these very big innovators — have become very profitable, which is a good thing because innovation is a good thing. That's the driver of the economy, that's how we get progress and growth.
At the same time, this past ecological change has also led to a lopsidedness within the industries, because an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or a Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is so productive and is so much better than anyone else that they actually grab the entire market.
Still, couldn’t an argument be made that these companies are giving the public what it wants?
JE: I'm the first one who loves Amazon, because I get a lot of stuff at a low price and it's very convenient. But the reason why they can do it is because our central tenets of competition don't work.

"As Amazon Readies For Prime Day, Rival Retailers Prepare Their Own Sales Events",2021-06-20 14:32:01+00:00,Phil Hall,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is preparing for its sixth annual Prime Day sales event that offers Amazon Prime members big discounts across nearly all categories on the e-commerce site.
This year, several of Amazon's retail rivals are trying to steal its thunder with their own discount-heavy events.
A Brief History: Amazon Prime Day was first observed on July 15, 2015, in celebration of the company’s 20th anniversary. The initial event lasted 24 hours was accessible to consumers in nine countries: the U.S., the UK, Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Canada and Austria.
Prime Day has traditionally been a summer happening, but due to last year’s COVID-19 pandemic, it was pushed back to October. The health crisis didn’t keep shoppers away — the event brought in more than $3.5 billion in sales from third-party sellers, up 60% from the previous year, and the company claimed Amazon Prime members saved a total of $1.4 billion in discounts during the event.

"FAANG Stocks In First-half: Last Year's Laggards Google, Facebook Come On Top As Apple, Amazon And Netflix Fall Off",2021-06-20 20:54:10+00:00,Shanthi Rexaline,"The broader market witnessed some scare in the early part of the first half of 2021 but came back up strongly to stay close to record territory.
The volatility seen in the broader market was largely a function of the swings in technology stocks, especially the big ones.
Here's a look at how the high-profile tech stocks going by the moniker ""FAANG"" fared during the volatile period:
Broader Market's ""Up-down-up"" Move:  The S&P 500, which is a considered a broader gauge of overall market performance, closed 2020 just shy of its all-high. Subsequently, the index experienced some volatility and was largely rangebound.
In late January, the market suffered a sell-off, which was blamed on the speculative behavior of retail investors.
Although the market bounced back up fairly soon, another sell-off, orchestrated by tech meltdown, ensued in early March.
After a broadly higher move until early May, the market retreated yet again but this time around the pullback was short-lived.
The resilient market shot back up and is hovering near record territory despite macroeconomic worries over rising inflation.

5 3D Printing Stocks Worth Following,2021-07-04 14:49:52+00:00,Phil Hall,"3D printing has created everything from knick-knacks to single-family houses, and its potential appears limitless. Among the most recent product developments generated by this technology are plant-based steaks, reusable rockets, aircraft engines and a schoolhouse in Malawi.
The global market for 3D printing products and services was valued at approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, according to data from Statista Research Department, and it is forecasted to expand at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 17% between 2020 and 2023.
No less of a figure than Cathie Wood, whose Ark Invest runs an exchange-traded fund partly focused on 3D printing, has declared it to be “one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy.”
In many ways, the 3D printing industry represents a work in progress as the full gamut of applications from this technology is slowly being embraced by different sectors.
For your consideration, here are five 3D printing companies whose stocks might deserve an extra bit of attention.
Nano Dimension Ltd - ADR: (NASDAQ: NNDM) This Israeli company was founded in 2012 and is best known for its proprietary DragonFly technology using digital files and simultaneous 3D-printing of dielectric and conductive materials to create multilayered electronic devices. A version 2.0 of the technology was announced in May.
Among the recent developments at the company have been the hiring of former Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) executive Sean Patterson as its president for the Americas, the acquisitions of 3D micro-printing provider NanoFabrica Ltd. and machine learning/deep learning provider DeepCube Ltd. and a joint venture with Germany’s Hensoldt AG focused on creating the next generation of 3D electronic printing designs.

Options Traders Feeling Market Fear Hammer The SPY Puts,2021-07-16 20:42:22+00:00,Melanie Schaffer,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) continued to pull back from its $437.92 all-time high on Friday. The SPY reached the record price twice on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, creating a bearish double top pattern.
The pullback has been attributed to inflation worries and increased spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but for bullish investors a pullback prior to big tech earnings allows for a sigh of relief because a run-up into earnings often becomes a ""sell the news"" event.
The three largest holdings in the SPY ETF consolidated Friday. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up 5.52% of the SPY, closed slightly lower while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), at 5.28%, failed to get follow-through on a new all-time high and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), at 3.8%, closed down over 1%.
While a number of bullish options traders purchased call contracts of the SPY, the Friday afternoon trades skewed overwhelmingly toward the bears. Together bearish traders bet over $9.12 million the SPY has room to fall further.
See Also: Wall Street Crime And Punishment: Thomas F. Quinn's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World
Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays the market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.
These types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.
The SPY Trades: Below is a look at the notable options alerts, courtesy of Benzinga Pro:

At 12:36 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep near the ask of 4,521 SPY options with a strike price of $355 expiring on Aug. 20. The trade represented a $194,403 bearish bet for which the trader paid 43 cents per option contract.

"Earnings Pace Picks Up Later Today With Chipotle, Netflix Expected To Report",2021-07-20 14:07:41+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"On the day Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos launches himself into space, most investors would probably be happy just to see the major indices pick themselves off the carpet after yesterday’s meltdown.
Early on, it looks like they might get their wish. Major indices rebounded overnight after the worst day in 10 months, with some of the “reopening” stocks that got pounded yesterday showing signs of a “turnaround Tuesday.” The key could end up being what happens after the first 30 minutes of trading. Spillover from the overnight session may carry things higher at first, but then we’ll see if there’s any continued momentum for the rest of the day. 
Two of the factors that helped lead things down yesterday popped up just a bit this morning, which may be why stocks turned green in pre-market trading. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed a fraction but remains below 1.2%, and crude oil also made a tiny move higher but is still trading below $67 a barrel. Weakness in yields and crude yesterday were seen by some as signals of possible slowing economic growth. 
It also helps to see Big Blue—IBM (NYSE: IBM)—reporting a strong quarter after the close yesterday. The company beat analysts’ estimates on top- and bottom-lines, and the CEO said IBM sees continued signs of strength in the cloud market and customer demand. Shares are up more than 3% in the pre-market. Travelers (NYSE: TRV) also had a good quarter and saw shares rebound, which may be sending positive vibes.
As we’ve talked about before, the “buy the dip” mentality appears to remain in place. People, like sports teams, tend to keep running the play that’s been working, and lately, it’s worked a lot. We’ll see if it picks up some momentum. But remember: past isn’t prologue, and complacency and trading are like oil and water. 
Volatility, Delta Variant, Earnings Among Things to Watch
After a day like yesterday it’s arguably fair to say we’re far from out of the woods. First of all, when the market takes a smack in the face like that there are often reverberations for days or even weeks. Volatility is a little lower this morning, but the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is still above 21 after falling into the mid-teens recently. Anything above 20 could signal worries of turbulence ahead, though it’s probably constructive that VIX never got anywhere near 30 yesterday. 
Also, the Delta variant of Covid—which appeared to help trigger much of yesterday’s selling by speculators—hasn’t gone anywhere. Yesterday’s U.S. caseload was the highest daily count since early May, according to media reports. Major indices fell in Asia overnight but rose in Europe. 
Earnings season officially started last week, but will accelerate in the days to come. This afternoon and tomorrow morning are expected to bring results from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), among others. Those three could give investors a well-rounded look into how factors like higher prices, the Delta variant, and reopening are playing into consumer preferences. With Netflix, ...",News|Earnings|Government|Cryptocurrency|Regulations|Guidance|Retail Sales|Restaurants|IPOs|Global|Markets|Tech|Media|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/07/22062639/earnings-pace-picks-up-later-today-with-chipotle-netflix-expected-to-report

3 Stocks That Could Hit $1 Trillion Market Cap Next,2021-07-21 12:20:24+00:00,Chris Katje,"Several big market capitalization milestones have happened in 2021 with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) joining the $1 trillion club and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) marking a $2 trillion milestone.
There are currently five companies trading with market caps of more than $1 trillion with former member Facebook now falling just shy at $965 billion, according to Assetdash.com.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) leads the way with a market cap of $2.38 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $2.09 trillion, Saudi Aramco at $1.86 trillion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) at $1.79 trillion and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $1.75 trillion.

Amazon Discusses Cannabis In Washington D.C.; Will It Actively Push For Legalization And Why?,2021-07-22 14:55:40+00:00,Nina Zdinjak,"In June, corporate giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it was time to adjust its outdated cannabis policy and told the world it will no longer test for marijuana for most of its job positions. The online retailer also declared its support for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act).
Having one of the largest companies in the U.S. openly supporting cannabis-related initiatives is an important milestone in and of itself. Now it turns out, there's more.  
The Seattle-headquartered company is apparently trying to persuade other corporations and Congress to support federal cannabis legalization, according to Politico.
Amazon Discussed Federal Cannabis Policy

What Happened: Rivian currently has a manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois and a second plant will help the EV startup expand capacity and include a 50 gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery cell production operation, as per Reuters, which first reported the development.

"Snap, Twitter Earnings Impress, Potentially Setting Table For Facebook Next Week",2021-07-23 14:15:12+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Last Friday was when the bottom began to fall out. A week later, things feel very different as earnings continue to hold the day.
We’re on pace for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to be up 1% for the week if things don’t head lower today, which is pretty amazing when you consider what happened Monday. It arguably indicates how much resilience remains in the market. A positive session today, if it happens, would be the fourth straight. 
The big comeback since Monday has been powered by solid earnings across a bunch of different industries. Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) got in on the fun, perhaps setting the table for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and other tech giants next week. Strong user growth reported by SNAP helped lift shares in pre-market trading, and TWTR shares rose after the company reported revenue that exceeded the average analyst estimate. 
If there’s a soft spot so far, it’s arguably in the semiconductor area. Both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) failed to impress investors with their outlooks, and shares of both are playing defense. 
Aside from that, we’ve seen nice reports this week from across a wide range of industries, including Health Care, Tech, and this morning in Financials as American Express (NYSE: AXP) appeared to impress with its results. It’s still very early and a lot could change, with next week representing the peak of reporting season. Things are off to a nice start with some of the heavyweights, though, including quarterly performance and the majority of company outlooks. 
Another good thing to see early today is the 10-year Treasury yield popping back up and knocking on the door of 1.3% again, which in theory could help Financials. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is back below 17. That’s after it jumped to nearly 25 on Monday. Now it’s down to where it spent most of its time a week or two ago before the craziness began. 
If there’s anything that could potentially knock stocks off their pedestal, it might be worries about China’s continued regulatory crackdown. Shares of China’s ride-sharing firm DiDi (NYSE: DIDI) fell sharply in pre-market trading after Bloomberg reported that Beijing is considering harsh penalties for the company. Shares of some other Chinese companies listed in the U.S. are also getting hurt before the open. So far, this weakness doesn’t appear to be spilling into the broader market, but keep an eye on it just in case. 
Mega-Caps Bask In Their Gains
If you want to sum up Thursday’s action on Wall Street, maybe it’s fair to say the mega-caps are back. 
We’re talking Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), all members of the $1 trillion market-cap club, advancing more than 1% even as the broader market barely budged. ...",News|Earnings|Government|Regulations|Guidance|Retail Sales|Small Cap|Federal Reserve|Tech|Media|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/07/22125537/snap-twitter-earnings-impress-potentially-setting-table-for-facebook-next-week

U.S. Surgeon General Bashes Prohibition

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said on Sunday that he does not think there is value to incarcerating people for marijuana use and that science should be our guide in policymaking.

“When it comes to decriminalization, I don't think that there is value to individuals or to society to lock people up for marijuana use. I don't think that serves anybody well,” Murthy told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Dash asked Murthy if he supported, from a health perspective, the draft bill unveiled last week by Senator Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to legalize cannabis at the federal level. Murthy replied that, when discussing marijuana, science should be at the forefront.

“I do think that, in terms of our approach to marijuana, I worry when we don't let science guide our process in policy-making,” Murthy said.

Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo.

“And we know the science tells us that there are some benefits to marijuana from a medical perspective but there are also some harms that we have to consider—and we have to put those together as we think about the right policy.”

Amazon Lobbying For Cannabis

In June, corporate giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) said it would adjust its outdated cannabis policy and told the world it will no longer test for marijuana for most of its job positions. The online retailer also declared its support for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act).

Having one of the largest companies in the U.S. openly supporting cannabis-related initiatives is an important milestone in and of itself. Now it turns out, there's more.  

The Seattle-headquartered company is apparently trying to persuade other corporations and Congress to support federal cannabis legalization.

Based on a Politico report, several advocacy and industry groups such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), and Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) reported having met with Amazon executives in June to talk about federal marijuana policy. 

Many cannabis legalization advocates are now looking to Amazon, hoping the company “will take the next step and use its considerable D.C. muscle to help get [the initiatives] passed,” according to Politico. 

Cannabis lobbyists in contact with Amazon have confirmed that the company has indeed gotten involved in the cannabis legalization debate in Washington, D.C. but whether the company is actively lobbying or monetarily backing the legislation is still unknown. 

“I'm quite disappointed that we've really seen no movement whatsoever at the federal level,” said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the Marijuana Policy Project. “I think that if Amazon were able to lend its political support to federal reform and fund state-level efforts, that would be a net positive for the cannabis reform movement in this country.”

Colombia’s New Law

Colombian President Ivan Duque Marquez signed on Friday afternoon a law that would allow for larger amounts of dry cannabis flower to be exported from the country. The signing followed a meeting with the leading Colombian cannabis producers.

Last week's bullish calls included the iPhone maker, a top oilfield services stock and a pharmaceutical giant.
FAANG stocks, the top cryptocurrency and meme stocks were among the bearish calls seen.

After a shaky start, the markets bounced back this past week from the prior week's dip into the red. The Nasdaq led the big U.S. indexes with an almost 3% gain for the week, while the S&P 500 was up about 2% and Dow Jones industrial average about 1% higher.
COVID-19 has been creeping back into the headlines, partly due to the Tokyo Olympics. That has prompted fears that the economic recovery might stumble. Both crude prices and Bitcoin slumped during the week, while chip shortages and inflation remained. The brewing debt ceiling fight in Congress is only just getting started.
However, the earnings-reporting season ramped up this week as well, and strong results from Dow Jones industrials helped buoy the markets. While the first FAANG component to post results disappointed, other strong tech sector reports have increased the high expectations for the coming week's results from the iPhone maker and market darling.

"Packed Earnings Week Begins, With Apple, Amazon, Facebook Among Companies Reporting",2021-07-26 14:44:00+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Welcome to a week that might offer something for everyone. 
The next few days include earnings from four of the five “FAANG” companies and one-third of the S&P 500 overall. There’s also a Fed meeting, and Congress could be making progress on an infrastructure bill. Get ready for possible volatility amid all this news. 
Last week featured an amazing turnaround that really helped demonstrate the resilience of this market. If someone had told you after Monday’s selloff that we’d end up being higher for the week with indices back at record levels, you might have thought they were crazy. But that’s what happened, and the market seemed to gather more strength going into Friday’s close. 
What’s driving this? It’s probably earnings, at least to some extent. And we’re about to start one of the biggest earnings weeks of the quarter featuring 180 of the companies in the S&P 500 and one-third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) components, so don’t touch your dial. 
Major indices rose four sessions in a row through Friday but turned lower in overnight trading heading into the new week. Pressure from losses in Asia might be a  factor. It’s also a bit worrisome to see the 10-year Treasury yield fall back below 1.25% in the early going after flirting with 1.3% on Friday. Weaker yields sometimes suggest concerns about economic growth.
Nearly 90% of Companies Beating Street’s Earnings Estimates
By Friday, 24% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results for Q2. Of these, 88% reported EPS above consensus estimates, FactSet said. That compares to the five-year average of 75%. 
Earnings estimates for the quarter as a whole are on their way up, too, with FactSet now estimating Q2 earnings growth of 74.2%, compared with its previous estimate of 69.4%. Positive earnings surprises reported by companies in multiple sectors (led by the Financials, Health Care, Information Technology, and Communication Services sectors) led to improvement in the overall earnings estimate over the past week, FactSet said. 
This week’s calendar is packed. Some of the major companies expected to report include Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Leaving TSLA aside, that’s quite a mouthful of FAANGs. Microsoft (MSFT), sometimes thought of as an honorary FAANG, is also on the calendar. 
Financials and a lot of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) stocks started earnings off with a good tone, but you could argue that the real heavyweight fight begins this week with the AAPLs and the MSFTs. They likely need to come through with solid results to keep this rally going. 
What’s a little unclear is how much of a role Treasury yields are playing. They initially bulked up early last week after falling sharply on Monday, but then they just couldn’t keep up the pace with stocks and ended Friday at 1.28% for the benchmark 10-year yield. The 1.3% level looks like a key one and it didn’t get seriously tested much despite the stock market rally.

Microsoft Focuses Aggressively On Cloud Ahead Of Fiscal Q4 Earnings Report,2021-07-26 20:43:46+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shook the heavens of commerce and capital when it shattered the $2 trillion market cap barrier last month.
The software giant is now one of only two companies in the world—the other being Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)—to boast a $2 trillion market cap, and one of only five companies across the globe, the other three being Saudi Aramco, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), to be part of the trillionaire club.
Since CEO Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, MSFT’s share price is up more than 600%. After reaching $500 billion in market cap in 2017, it took only two years to double to $1 trillion and then two more years to double again to $2 trillion. The next trillion, if we get there, is now only half the distance away.
MSFT is expected to report fiscal Q4 earnings on Tuesday after markets close.
When you look at MSFT from a 40,000-foot view, it seems pretty clear that the company has reinvented itself several times since taking root in software. Now a multi-industry behemoth weaving itself across the entire digital domain from ground to digital sky, MSFT arguably has become virtually omnipresent.
And its recent market-cap surge reflects the opportunities it saw and seized: investing in cloud computing, developing virtual chat and collaboration tech, expanding into the video game market, and satiating its large appetite for acquisitions.
Before looking at some of the segments, it’s important to note that MSFT has beaten Wall Street’s consensus on earnings and revenue each of the last four quarters. Accelerating business IT spending could help bring another strong quarterly result this time around, analysts told Barron’s recently.

"Mega-Cap Mania: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings All Ahead After Close Today",2021-07-27 14:12:43+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"Now’s when it starts to get really interesting.
After the close today, investors can look forward to a tech triple-header as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) open the books on their latest quarters. Following that, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) earnings loom tomorrow afternoon, and along the way there’s a Fed meeting.
Things don’t calm down Thursday, either, with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stepping to the plate that afternoon following the government’s first look at Q2 gross domestic product in the morning.
In all, that should be enough trillion-dollar companies, data, and Fed talk to keep everyone busy. Tech results certainly could exert a major influence on the market as a whole, depending on how they do. Other key companies reporting over the next few days are expected to include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Ford (NYSE: F), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck (NYSE: MRK), and Boeing (NYSE: BA), none of which are exactly ones you can ignore.
Early on this week as the “mega-cap” Tech companies report, it will be interesting to see if the big Tech names move in one direction and pull the broader market with them, or if they offset each other. If it’s the second scenario, the broader indices might not have much direction, considering the power these mega-caps have to pull things one way or the other. If there’s a tug-of-war, the big indices might not move much.
The wild card could be the Fed meeting, which comes in the middle of all this. Wednesday’s Fed meeting conclusion is at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. Sometimes the market trades in a tight range ahead of a Fed meeting, but it’s unclear if that will be the case this time considering there’s no expectation from Wall Street analysts of any policy moves by the central bank. 
Tesla Throws Out The First Pitch
Monday had its own earnings headline as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) got things started after the close. Shares inched up just a little after the company beat analysts’ average expectations on the top- and bottom-lines, but the stock has basically been in a holding pattern much of the year between $600 and $700 a share and remains there for now. The beat on earnings looked pretty strong, but revenue wasn’t much above consensus. 
Still, the fact that TSLA shares rose at all after earnings had to be a bit of relief considering shares fell immediately after it reported the previous period’s results despite having its first $1 billion earnings quarter. Focus this time out centers on TSLA’s progress in China, a key market for the company where competition is growing. 
As Reuters reported, for the first time since late 2019, TSLA’s profits didn’t rely on sales of environmental credits to other automakers, a potential sign of increasing financial health for the manufacturing ...",News|Earnings|Guidance|Global|Federal Reserve|Tech|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/07/22173912/mega-cap-mania-apple-alphabet-microsoft-earnings-all-ahead-after-close-today

"Amazon Prepares To Open The Books On Q2, Strong Sales Expected But Concerns Hover",2021-07-27 16:37:26+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"When Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reveals its Q2 results after the market closes this Thursday, there seems to be little doubt among analysts that the online shopping juggernaut will report solid earnings growth.
So why is its stock lagging the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 (NDX) Index? (see chart below)
Maybe call it shopping fatigue. There is concern that AMZN can’t keep up its torrid pace set last year when the pandemic sent virtually everyone who needed to buy anything to the online uber shopping mall.
Combined with the persistent issues of bipartisan support to address antitrust complaints, investors are now watching to see if AMZN’s stock price could be headed for the sales rack.
Has Online Shopping Peaked?
To be clear, the bar set in 2020 is high. Very high. Estimates for Q2 sales revenue growth are for at least 24%, according to Wall Street’s consensus views. Long tailwinds still blowing from last year’s pandemic-fueled shopping habits have not yet abated. But investors appear to be doubting that the pace can continue.
To wit: In the first half of this year, AMZN’s stock has gained 7%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NDX is up 14%. This is despite AMZN trouncing analysts’ estimates when AMZN reported Q1 earnings of $15.79 per share, versus $9.54 per share expected. Revenue was $108.52 billion versus $104.47 billion expected.
For its part, AMZN isn’t projecting declines in Q2. Company guidance is for net sales to be between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion, or to grow between 24% and 30% compared to the year-ago quarter.
One potential dip in sales growth might come from Amazon Prime Day, which was held June 21–22, an event AMZN has usually characterized with a string of superlatives.

"Afternoon Face-To-Face with Facebook, Fed Chairman Powell, Next On Calendar",2021-07-28 14:29:10+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"There’s going to be a slight interruption in the earnings parade later today when the Fed concludes its meeting. 
The question is whether the Fed might say anything about tapering its stimulus later this month at its Jackson Hole symposium. Today’s statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference could provide insight into the timing of a future policy announcement. More about the Fed below. 
Before the Fed meeting, the focus remains on earnings following Tuesday’s reports from three of the largest companies in the world and a surprising quarterly profit this morning from Boeing (NYSE: BA). If you were looking for more evidence that big-Tech continues to thrive, Tuesday afternoon’s trifecta of earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) might have gone a long way. 
Though all three mega-cap companies over-delivered on Wall Street’s expectations, the market results arguably didn’t reflect the standout reports. Two of the three stocks fell initially after releasing their results, though MSFT managed to get back into the green later in the after-hours session. AAPL shares remain slightly lower in pre-market trading. 
By now you’re probably familiar with the numbers each of these behemoths announced late yesterday, so we’ll spare you the details. Let’s just note that what really stood out from a 30,000-foot perspective was the revenue chalked up by all three. 
Big-Tech Revenue Exceeding Pre-Covid Levels
A 69% increase in GOOGL ad revenue was pretty impressive, with YouTube driving a bunch of that. AAPL’s iPhone revenue of nearly $40 billion came in near the very top-end of the range of analyst estimates and probably tells you demand is a bit more robust than maybe Wall Street had thought going in. 
MSFT’s overall revenue was about $2 billion above the average Wall Street estimate, with sales of its Azure cloud platform rising 51% to outpace the growth seen in the last two quarters. That’s quite a feat considering how fast Azure was already growing. MSFT seems like it’s trying to defeat the law of large numbers. GOOGL’s cloud revenue, which doesn’t face the challenge of MSFT’s more established platform when it comes to that old law, rose an even faster 54%. 
One minor demerit worth mentioning for MSFT might have been that Azure cloud growth decelerated on a constant-currency basis. Investors still want them to gain ground on Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
You could argue that some of the sparkling revenue growth we saw across the big three yesterday reflected easy comparisons to a year ago when the economy was tangled in the Covid thicket much more than it is today. That’s certainly something that helps explain overall earnings growth in Tech and beyond, considering the expenses so many companies had to wrestle with back then and the lockdown of the world economy. 
Revenue growth, however, is impressive even with the comparisons. MSFT’s revenue was the highest ever for any quarter, which means better than anything it ever managed in the pre-Covid era. AAPL’s revenue of $81.4 billion compared with revenue of $53.8 billion in the same quarter two years ago, a sign that business has expanded massively over the course of the pandemic. 
So considering all that, why are shares not moving higher for all three? Perhaps it’s a reflection of valuations, which have ...",News|Earnings|Guidance|Commodities|Markets|Tech|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/07/22198644/afternoon-face-to-face-with-facebook-fed-chairman-powell-next-on-calendar

"Data Disappointments: Q2 GDP Growth Softer Than Expected, While Jobless Claims Remain High",2021-07-29 14:19:19+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"Earnings and the Fed have dominated the week up until now, but this morning data finds a spot in the sun. 
U.S. Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) and a fresh batch of initial jobless claims are front and center today, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings wait in the wings for after the close. 
Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) shares fell in overnight trading after the company said revenue growth will slow. This is worth putting into perspective, because comparisons to the year-earlier period start getting tough in coming quarters. As FB put it in their press release, the company is starting to “lap” periods of very strong growth. 
Getting back to the data, the government’s first look at Q2  GDP came in at 6.5%, which would probably have looked incredibly healthy at basically any other time in the last 30 years but sounds like a disappointment now. That’s because going into the report, analysts had expected an 8.5% gain, according to consensus gathered by research firm Briefing.com. The Q1 growth was 6.4%, so today’s data might feed into notions that maybe the economy is cresting. It is worth noting, though, that today’s GDP number means the economy is now larger than it was in pre-Covid days, a significant achievement.
Investors also got a look at the weekly initial jobless claims data, and it also isn’t likely to warm the hearts of economic bulls. For the second straight week, the headline figure hit 400,000, this time right on the nose. That’s down from a revised 424,000 the prior week but slightly above consensus expectations for 385,000. 
The major indices, which were mixed in pre-market trading as investors awaited the data, didn’t immediately make any large swings in the immediate aftermath of the numbers. One way the data could potentially support stocks is by suggesting the economy still needs help, meaning the Fed could be in less of a hurry to change accommodative policy. That would reaffirm some of what we heard yesterday after the Fed’s latest meeting. 
Fed Wraps Up An Uneventful Meeting
The Fed meeting conclusion yesterday was pretty uneventful as the central bank kept policy unchanged with rates still near zero and no updated timetable on slowing its $120 billion a month stimulus program. In general, it was kind of a summer “placeholder” meeting for the Fed, which also didn’t provide any updates in its economic forecast. 
Rising prices “largely reflect transitory factors,” the Fed said. Sounds familiar. The Fed sees improvement in the economy coming out of the pandemic, but says we’re not all the way back yet, especially in the sectors that suffered most. Also very much in line with its previous statements.
One interesting thing about Powell’s press conference yesterday was​​ how he made what sounded like a pretty definitive statement about the price environment. “We won’t have an extended period of high inflation,” Powell said. “Some will fall away as the process of reopening the economy moves through over time.” 
He said the near-term inflation risk is “to the upside” but has confidence that will be less of the case in the medium term.

"Strong Month; Weak Finish: Stocks, Treasury Yields Under Pressure In Early Friday Trading",2021-07-30 14:13:07+00:00,Shawn Cruz,"Whether you’re running for the gold medal in Tokyo or running for honor in the three-legged race at the summer barbecue, it’s no fun to stumble at the finish.
After a slew of earnings reports, economic releases, and a Fed meeting, the end of the week—and month—was in sight. But if the overnight weakness carries over into the trading day, it could be a weak finish to what had been a strong month.  
One catalyst has been yesterday’s earnings report from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which were solid, but not the full-on blowout the street was expecting. Although earnings beat estimates, it was the missed revenue expectations and downside Q3 guidance that sent shares lower in aftermarket trading. AMZN’s stock price fell as low as about 7% after the close. 
Futures on the major indices fell in overnight trading, with the tech-centric Nasdaq-100 (/NQ) taking the biggest hit, down well over 1% at one point. Equity index futures are lower ahead of the open with the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) set to open down about 1.2%. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which have a high weighting in the NDX and other indices, are all set to open lower. With index weakness—plus a 10-year yield back below 1.25% and pop in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) approaching 20, it’s looking like a “risk-off” start to the day.  
Beyond The FAANGs
The five FAANGs earnings may be out of the way but there’s a lot more coming up. Earnings continue to roll in next week, too, but the huge crush of big-Tech reports is out of the way. Some of the key ones to consider watching include Uber (NYSE: UBER), Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Hyatt Hotels (NYSE: H), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), and Marriott (NASDAQ: MAR).
There’s plenty of data on the calendar, too. None arguably more important than what’s on the schedule a week from today when investors get a look at the July payrolls report.
As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this week, the jobs picture is improving but is far from being all the way back from Covid. Last month’s 5.9% unemployment rate actually ticked a bit higher from May, to 5.9% from 5.8%. Jobs growth in June was very strong at 850,000, but economic bulls would probably like to see a couple of strong reports strung together. Data have been kind of lumpy so far this year.
We’ll look at analysts’ outlook for jobs and wage growth next week. Besides that key report, other important numbers to watch include Monday’s July ISM Manufacturing figure. It was a strong 60.6% the prior month, but that’s diminished from the spring peaks. Any number above 50% indicates expansion. With Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) a little soft, that could elevate the importance of the ISM number for those trying to get a sense of where the economy has been.
Yesterday’s GDP and jobs numbers didn’t seem to hurt the stock markets too much.

9 Amazon Analysts Break Down Q2 Earnings: 'Comps Tougher Than Expected',2021-07-30 18:13:57+00:00,Wayne Duggan,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares traded lower by 7% on Friday after the company reported slowing revenue growth in the second quarter and issued weak guidance for the second half of the year.
Amazon reported second-quarter adjusted EPS of $15.12, beating analyst estimates of $12.30. Revenue for the quarter was $113.0 billion, missing consensus forecasts of $115.2 billion. Revenue was up 27% from a year ago.
Amazon Web Services revenue was up 37% to $14.81 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $14.2 billion. Amazon’s “Other” segment revenue, which includes advertising and other services, was up 87%.
Looking ahead, Amazon guided for third-quarter revenue of between $106 billion and $112 billion, well below analyst estimates of $119.2 billion. The guidance range represents between 10% and 16% year-over-year growth, a sharp drop from the roughly 40% growth Amazon has reported in the last several quarters.

Last week's bullish calls included two FAANG stocks, a Bitcoin play and an industrial giant.
The e-commerce colossus and electric vehicle and video streaming leaders were among the bearish calls seen.

July has come and gone, and the big three U.S. indexes ended modestly lower last week, led by the 1% or so retreat of the Nasdaq. For the month, the S&P 500 was up almost 3%, and the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrials each were less than 2% higher.
The earnings spotlight was on big tech last week, which offered earnings beats all around, but some with impressive revenue numbers and others not so much. Then there was the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve, which had nothing new to add as it sticks with its belief that inflation pressures are transitory. Neither the second-quarter gross domestic product figure nor the jobless claims numbers for the week offered much for investors to get excited about either.

Could August Become 7th Straight Month Of Gains? Busy Week Could Set The Tone,2021-08-02 14:21:05+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"And so begins the month of August. The dog days of summer. Beaches, mountains, and lazy afternoons.If you follow the financial markets, that thinking might be jumping the gun, as there’s still plenty of action ahead.
Although last week was arguably the height of earnings season, with releases from four of the five FAANGs, plus Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and other top-tier companies across the sectors, this week will still be quite busy with earnings. Plus, Friday marks the day when the monthly employment report is released. Some analysts see this one as a potential watershed report, considering several Fed governors—including Chair Powell—have said the central bank plans to tie any potential policy changes to employment growth. More on that below.    
A String Of Gains For Stock Indices
Would the market close higher for the sixth consecutive month? That was the thought that was probably going through most investors’ minds on Friday. And from the way stocks performed on Thursday and early Friday, there was likely some concern that it wouldn’t. But in the end, the market made it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) was up 1.25%, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) up 2.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (COMP: GIDS) up 1.2% for July. That’s in spite of a lower close for the day and week for all three indices. The selloff in tech stocks, most likely led by Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) lower than expected earnings, may have had something to do with it (more on that below).
Might we see the seventh month of gains? The first trading day in August begins with optimistic sentiment with equity index futures higher ahead of the open. We saw a lot of momentum in the futures market overnight, helped by a 2% rebound in China’s Shanghai Composite Index. Japan’s Nikkei 225, which had also struggled in recent days, rose 1.82% last night.
There’s also a good chance of the bipartisan infrastructure bill being passed by the Senate. If all the final wrangling gets done over the next couple of weeks—they still have to settle on amendments—it could give a lift to some of the traditional industrial companies.
Looking Ahead
Last week was the busiest earnings stretch of the season—about 59% of the SPX companies have already reported quarterly earnings. Of these companies, 88% have reported earnings per share above consensus estimates, and that’s above the five-year average of 75% according, to FactSet. Now the fun continues with another packed schedule.
Some influential reports expected this week include Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), Uber (NYSE: UBER), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA), MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM), Take-Two (NASDAQ: TTWO), CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), and Square (NYSE: SQ).

"The 5 Strangest J.R.R. Tolkien Films That Never Got Made — And Al Pacino, The Beatles Were Supposed To Star",2021-08-03 22:03:02+00:00,Phil Hall,"Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien are happy to know that Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) that the new series based on “The Lord of the Rings” will have its streaming debut on Sept. 2, 2022.
However, Middle Earth movie history is littered with multiple attempts to adapt the Tolkien trilogy to the screen. These failed efforts involved some of the biggest talents in the entertainment industry, as well as some creative artists with a decidedly sketchy pedigree.
For your consideration, here are five of the most intriguing “Lord of the Rings” adaptations that never advanced into production.
1. Bilbo Baggins Meets Mickey Mouse? Tolkien’s fiction haunted Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) ever since the publication of “The Hobbit” in 1937. The production team on Disney’s masterwork “Fantasia” toyed with merging elements of “The Hobbit” into selections from Richard Wagner’s “Ring” cycle, but it was rejected as not fitting into the personality of the film.
Walt Disney himself proposed a “The Lord of the Rings” animated feature, and the idea was later raised after Disney’s death, but the studio was unable to telescope Tolkien’s grand vision into a standalone feature film.
2. The Hobbled Hobbit: If Disney represented the apex of animation, the team of William L.

Benzinga talked with Lutes about cryptocurrency, the coffee business, and his future plans on opening a DOGE-themed establishment.
Community Was The Draw: For Lutes, it was the DOGE Army, which made him fall in love with the Shiba Inu. While he described himself to be “crypto-adjacent” since he had a lot of friends who were into cryptocurrency, he never quite understood it.

As a DOGE investor, who entered the coin at 7 cents in January, he thought he was a genius when he sold at 12 cents, but Lutes said he had underestimated the DOGE Army — a reference to the coin’s following.
“I started doing lots of research on crypto and just fell in love with the Dogecoin community in particular. This was a community that is built on fun, memes, Doing Only Good Everyday, and was a perfect on-ramp into crypto in general.”

Last week's bullish calls included the e-commerce colossus and some automakers.
The leading electric vehicle maker and a COVID-19 vaccine stock were among the bearish calls seen.

August began with six straight months of market gains in the books and the peak of this earnings season in the rearview mirror. While plenty more quarterly reports were on the docket last week, an overall positive season was beginning to look a bit more mixed. Ongoing COVID-19 and inflation concerns and some disappointing economic numbers contributed to a somewhat choppy week in the markets ahead of the July jobs report.
Returning COVID-19 restrictions put pressure on sectors such as travel, as well as on oil, and China continued its crackdown on internet companies. Yet, there was some strength in semiconductors and cybersecurity. The Federal Reserve remained on course eventually to raise interest rates, and retail traders continued their buy -the-dip strategy.
The markets rallied a bit into Friday's much anticipated employment report, which brought better than expected payrolls gains and unemployment rate.

6 Retail Stocks That Could Benefit From A Record-Breaking Back-To-School Shopping Season,2021-08-15 18:16:55+00:00,Chris Katje,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to the back-to-school shopping season in 2020 as parents braced for hybrid and at-home learning.
With many schools expecting to resume in-person learning in 2021, the back-to-school shopping season could be a potential boon for retailers.
Record-Breaking Back-to-School?: Families with children in K-12 schools are expected to spend $848.90 on average for the current back-to-school shopping season, according to NRF Research. This is an increase of $59 per family over the previous year.
Total back-to-school spending could reach $37.1 billion for 2021 compared to a total of $33.9 billion in the previous year. The estimated figure would represent an all-time high.
College student spending is expected to hit a record $71 billion, up $67.7 billion from the prior year.
“We enter the new school year with plans to return to the classroom and retailers are prepared to help Americans find and purchase whatever they need to make this transition as seamless as possible,” NRF CEO Matthew Shay said.
The survey shows that 51% of consumers began back-to-school shopping in July. Thirty-nine percent of survey respondents said they took advantage of large sale events such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Day, Target Deal Days and Deals for Days from Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).

"Retail Kicks Off Final Stretch Of Earnings Season Amid A Slew Of Manufacturing, Retail, And Housing Data",2021-08-16 14:12:25+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"It’s a shopping extravaganza this week as retailers line up to report. 
The fun starts tomorrow when Walmart (NYSE: WMT) steps to the plate. Before that, the focus this morning appears to be on the Fed, China, and Afghanistan. Data showed the Chinese economy growing a little slower than analysts had expected, which is one factor putting pressure on crude this morning.
China’s factory output and retail sales growth slowed sharply in July, Reuters reported, as new Covid outbreaks and floods disrupted business operations. This, following some other soft numbers recently, has some analysts worried that the recovery there is losing momentum. 
All this is happening thousands of miles away, but the ramifications could be big for the world’s economy, considering China is such a powerful force. Energy sector firms might feel some pressure today if demand worries keep crude on its heels. Materials companies and multinationals with big business operations in China could also come under a bit of scrutiny. 
Another thing thousands of miles away that appears to be weighing this morning is the collapse of Afghanistan. With that, the potential for political conflict has ticked up a notch. Major U.S. indices are near all-time highs, so people are, shall we say, a bit more sensitive. It arguably doesn’t take as much to trigger selling. 
Another thing to watch today is volatility, which rebounded pretty sharply overnight from last week’s lows and may reflect the Afghanistan news. It also could be building up in anticipation of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell participating in a town hall meeting tomorrow. This is one he’s doing with teachers and students, so it seems doubtful he’d make any major policy announcements. You never know, though. 
As Earnings Approach Finish Line, Looking Back At Great Quarter
By now, pretty much everyone following the market must be aware of what an outstanding Q2 earnings season we’ve had. A lot of the focus is on earnings per share, but remember that companies can manipulate income statements to make EPS cover up some other stuff. If you want a better look at exactly how much money is coming in, it’s hard to beat a look at the top line. 
As of Friday, 91% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual revenue numbers for Q2. Of these companies, 87% came in above the average analyst estimate, according to FactSet, with overall revenues averaging about 4.9% above expectations. The Health Care (97%), Communication Services (96%) and Information Technology (95%) sectors have the highest percentages of companies reporting revenue above estimates, FactSet said. 
What’s really amazing is that when you look at the five biggest tech companies—Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)—their earnings climbed sharply in Q2, and that was without the benefit of easy Covid comparisons. Remember, these companies were generally doing great in Q2 of 2020, benefiting from the “stay at home” economy during the lockdowns. So unlike, say, Financials and Industrials—which were going through very tough times in Q2 2020 and had easy comparisons this time around—big Tech didn’t have a built-in advantage and turned in a great performance despite that. 
Walmart, Target And Other Retailers All Reporting This Week
The earnings parade continues this week with retail firms storming to the front lines. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) leads off tomorrow morning and analysts sound pretty optimistic about the quarter, though they note WMT is up against tough year-ago comparisons. 
“Walmart U.S. sales growth may outpace Amazon’s total ‘online stores’ growth” thanks to added merchandise, same-day delivery, and pickup, and other perks,” Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) said in a recent note to clients. “We believe Walmart’s omnichannel ...",News|Earnings|Government|Regulations|Commodities|Retail Sales|Global|Federal Reserve|Markets|Tech|General|Real Estate,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22512319/retail-kicks-off-final-stretch-of-earnings-season-amid-a-slew-of-manufacturing-retail-and-housing-d
Walmart Options Traders Bet Big On Earnings Beat,2021-08-16 17:22:48+00:00,Melanie Schaffer,"Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) is set to print its second-quarter 2022 earnings before the markets open on Tuesday. On Monday morning, R5 Capital upgraded the stock to Buy and announced a price target of $169.
On Friday Pete Najarian said he believes Target Corp (NYSE: TGT) is stealing market share away from Walmart and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) as a result of Target’s partnerships and its investments back into its business.
Walmart is up over 12% from its June 18 low of $134.40 and on Friday was trying to break up from a bull flag pattern on the daily chart to surpass the Aug. 11 high of $151.58.
The retailer has certainly run up into its earnings event, which makes buying stock or bullish options risky. While a stock’s reaction to an earnings beat can be bearish and a miss can bring on a bearish reaction, it's more likely the stock will sell off if it’s run up into the event.
Walmart options traders weren’t fazed by the risk, however, and on Monday morning were hammering bullish call contracts. Together the traders purchased over $747,947 worth with one trader betting $115,500 on a single order of calls with a strike of $149 that expires on Sept. 10.

Walmart Earnings: Tough Comparisons Vs. 2020 As Focus Turns To E-Commerce,2021-08-16 20:15:57+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) ability to keep customers coming to its stores will again be on display when Q2 results are released tomorrow morning.
A year ago, people had few shopping options beyond WMT and a few other big stores that kept doors open through the pandemic. Now, with more choices, the question is what WMT is doing to keep old customers coming back and maintain the new ones who started shopping there in 2020.
For the most part, analysts think shopper traction has sustainability, some of it juiced by stimulus payments as well as a return to price-sensitive shopping. In Q1, WMT said foot traffic had picked up as COVID-19 mandates were lifted and shoppers ventured out to stores again.
“Our optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in May. “In the U.S., customers clearly want to get out and shop.”
Investors will see how well that panned out in Q2, especially considering the rise of the Delta variant late that quarter. Many analysts have said WMT appears to be doing just fine, thank you. McMillon kept a cautionary but upbeat tone last time out. “The second half has more uncertainty than a typical year. We anticipate continued pent-up demand throughout 2021.”
WMT Vs. AMZN?
Some analysts expect Q2 to be relatively strong, though they note WMT is up against tough year-ago comparisons. At Bank of America (NYSE: BA), analysts are more bullish on WMT sales growth than Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN).
“Walmart U.S. sales growth may outpace Amazon’s total ‘online stores’ growth” thanks to added merchandise, same-day delivery and pickup, and other perks,” BAC said in a recent note to clients.
“We believe Walmart’s omnichannel transformation in the U.S. will continue to gain momentum and support more sustainable and predictable positive same-store sales and traffic at U.S. supercenters and U.S. e-commerce,” the note said.
Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) believes WMT’s e-commerce site “continues to show signs of strength,” according to a recent report. Shoppers are forking over some $1,300 a year above their in-store outlay, powering an upswing in average annual spending as the pandemic drove consumers to shop online, according to CIRP.

6 Famous Gaming Streamers Who Left Twitch For YouTube,2021-09-03 12:10:09+00:00,Chris Katje,"In 2014, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) shocked the gaming world with the acquisition of streaming company Twitch. Amazon paid $970 million and came in while Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) was also in talks.
Twitch has been a dominant presence in the video game streaming world, signing exclusive deals with many of the biggest gamers. Over the years, several big names have left the Twitch platform, with most landing at rival YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.
Why Are Streamers Leaving? There are a number of factors going into top streamers leaving Twitch. A big reason is financial as YouTube appears to be signing large contracts with top names to grow its gaming division.
YouTube also gives more revenue to its content creators compared to a reported 50/50 split that Twitch offers most users.
Twitch has also been the subject of hate raids, where offensive comments are posted in the chat. Many Twitch streamers took part in #ADayOffTwitch calling for changes from the streaming company.
Demands included allowing streamers the ability to deny incoming rage, restrict based on age and implement additional anti-harassment tools.
“We support our streamers’ rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service,” Twitch told TechCrunch.
Twitch has a 72.3% market share of the streaming space, according to Streamlabs, but could see that figure fall if it continues to lose top names.

Amazon Stock Pulls Back Into Bullish Pattern As Market Digests Jobs Data,2021-09-03 15:15:18+00:00,Melanie Schaffer,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) opened lower despite reports it plans to launch Amazon-branded smart TVs in the U.S. next month. The stock was affected by the general markets opening lower due to a massive jobs report miss.
The U.S. reported job gains of just 235,000 in August, which missed the consensus estimate of 750,000, largely weighed down by the stagnant leisure and hospitality sector. The market bear break saw no follow-through, however, and by mid-morning the major indices were rebounding. Although the jobs numbers were disappointing, the miss could help ward off a potential tapering announcement when the Federal Reserve meets later this month.

Analyst Eric Sheridan identified the top 10 themes for the U.S. internet sector that could fuel growth in some of these stocks in 2021 and beyond.
1. Blurring Line Between Commerce & Advertising:  Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) demand generation and video advertising strategies, the rise of social shopping, marketplace models supplementing core revenue with ad revenue and the rise of seller marketplace models are all underlining the blurring of the lines between traditional digital advertising and e-commerce business models over the past two years, the analyst said.
Beneficiaries: Amazon, Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), with its namesake platform and Instagram, Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Snap Inc (NASDAQ: SNAP).
2. Rise of Creator Economy:  Unlike the rise of the social media news feed, the rise of creator tools, monetization aspects and the role of the ""influencer"" has created a new industry dynamic, Sheridan said.
Platforms embracing this shift are gaining time spent but have to share the unit economics of that traffic monetization with the content creator, he added.
Google's YouTube, the analyst said, is maintaining its relevance due to its global scale and monetization split. Rise of newer platforms such as TikTok and Cameo is likely to disrupt some of the time spent, he added.
Beneficiaries: Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Pinterest and SnapChat
3. Streaming Media Platform Reaching Global Scale:  Streaming media, including video and audio, will likely maintain much of the subscriber growth gains, Sheridan said.
Beneficiaries: Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT) and Amazon

"Benzinga's Bulls And Bears Of The Week: Apple, Boeing, Cisco, Moderna, Tesla And More",2021-09-18 14:11:00+00:00,Nelson Hem,"Benzinga has examined the prospects for many investor favorite stocks over the past week. 

Last week's bullish calls included tech giants and the leading electric vehicle maker.

The iPhone maker, a COVID-19 vaccine play and an aerospace giant were among the bearish calls seen.

The big three U.S. indexes ended the past week in the red, led by the 0.6% decline in the S&P 500. Good news on the inflation and retail fronts was not enough to offset ongoing worries about the spread of the Delta variant and what the Federal Reserve may have up its sleeve.
So far this month, the Dow Jones industrials are down 2.2% and the Nasdaq has lost 1.4%. All three indexes are down 2% or so from all-time highs but still up by double-digits for the year to date.
The past week also saw the much anticipated reveal of the iPhone 13 and other new Apple products. Boeing offered a rosy forecast for the next decade. Calls to break up the big banks have resumed, and stock trading by Federal Reserve presidents ruffled a few feathers.
Benzinga continues to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look.

"After Today's Fed Meeting, Investors Are Stuck With Contradictory Reports On Evergrande And The Debt Ceiling",2021-09-22 14:11:59+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Stocks appear set to open higher on Wednesday ahead of the Fed announcement. However, there’s no expectation that interest rates will change. Instead, investors will likely be looking for any signals of a delay in tapering plans. Currently, the feeling is that the risk of Evergrande becoming a “Lehman-type event” for China is unlikely and won’t affect the Fed’s plans.
Evergrande assured investors on Wednesday that it would make an interest payment on time. Although the Wall Street Journal reported that the company is still expected to miss a separate payment due to international investors. Investors appear to have an expectation that the Chinese government will step in to stave off any negative ripple effects that the Evergrande situation could cause.
The U.S. has its own government funding issues. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling that would fund the government until December 3. However, it’s unclear if the bill will make it through the Senate. Republicans have their own plan to fund the government without raising the debt ceiling, but it’s failing to make traction outside of the minority party. Democrats don’t need Republicans to pass the bill because of their majority. The problem is that the progressive wing of the Democrat party doesn’t want to pass the bill without passing the infrastructure bill that moderate Democrats have stalled.
 After today’s Fed meeting, Evergrande and the debt ceiling will give investors something to “look forward” to.  Unfortunately, it will likely be with contradictory information.
 U.S. tech companies certainly don’t need government help to buy real estate because they’re flush with cash. Despite the expectation for a hybrid workspace where workers may split time between the office and home, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google announced plans to buy $2.1 billion office building in New York City. This is just the latest in the trend by tech companies buying up office space.

ANALYSIS: Is Amazon's Eddie Murphy Deal Going To Work?,2021-09-23 19:30:13+00:00,Phil Hall,"The announcement by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) that it signed Eddie Murphy to a three-picture deal with its Amazon Studios subsidiary gives the Emmy-winning funnyman a new turn in the spotlight.
But in view of Murphy’s erratic track record over the past two decades — with highs including his Oscar-nominated role in “Dreamgirls” and lows involving a multitude of box office flops — is Amazon getting its money’s worth with Murphy?
To determine the viability of this deal, Benzinga polled several prominent film writers who have tracked both Murphy’s career and the rise of the streaming industry. The consensus, it appears, is a very cautious yes.

A Shaky Star: Murphy first gained audience attention during his 1980-1984 stint on “Saturday Night Live,” with many cultural critics singling him out as the primary reason the show was able to carry forward after the departure of its original cast and founding executive producer Lorne Michaels. He established himself as a film star with his first big screen role in 1982’s “48 Hrs.”
While it seemed that Murphy could do no wrong at the box office in the 1980s, his career began to hit potholes in the 1990s when many of his films either made mild profits or tanked upon arrival.

Although Murphy gained younger fans and refueled his box office cred in family-friendly films including the “Shrek” and “Dr. Dolittle” franchises and “Daddy Day Care,” Murphy also racked up a number a large number of unmistakable flops including “Show Time,” “I Spy,” “The Adventures of Pluto Nash,” “Meet Dave,” “Imagine That” and “Mr. Church” — the latter film, distributed in U.S. theaters in 2016 by the independent Cinelou Releasing, brought in less than $700,000 at the box office.

Friday's Market Minute: Takeaways From Another Volatile Earnings Season,2021-09-24 14:12:59+00:00,TD Ameritrade Network,"For many, Nike’s (NYSE: NKE) quarterly report means the unofficial end to earnings season. While bank earnings are now only a few weeks away, marking the start to the third-quarter reports, the second quarter was one worth noting. Since the pandemic sent the broader market into disarray roughly a year and a half ago, each quarter’s reports have brought on their own set of hills and valleys.
The average earnings growth for the period was over 93%, which is the highest on record since 4Q of 2009. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, earnings grew over 6% on average from 1Q21 to 2Q21 and were well above year-ago levels (although facing relatively easy comps to last year’s economic backdrop). Revenue also grew substantially, posting the largest improvement compared to the last nine quarters.
Plus, not only was there a record amount of companies beating earnings estimates, but these companies also beat expectations by a much higher margin compared to historical levels. Over 87% of companies beat in 2Q, which tied for the highest percentage beat rate in history. The earnings beat was also 87% in 1Q21, 79% in 4Q20, 84% in 3Q20, and 82% in 2Q20 – showing the real strength of the last five quarters. For historical context, the average beat rate since 1994 stands at roughly 66%.
Within the heavily traded and scrutinized FAANG stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the only company that reported revenue that disappointed the Street. It was also the e-commerce giant’s first miss since 3Q of 2018, and the stock saw a good amount of selling following the miss (-7.5%). Nike also saw some pressure after reporting a bottom-line beat, but a miss on the top line. The athletic apparel retailer highlighted one major theme that has been mentioned consistently throughout the quarter: supply chain disruptions. Nike’s management said its fiscal 1Q sales would have been higher than reported, if not for supply-chain issues.
While it is unclear how to gauge ...",News|Earnings|Guidance|Futures|Commodities|Retail Sales|Global|Economics|Federal Reserve|Markets|General,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/09/23090434/fridays-market-minute-takeaways-from-another-volatile-earnings-season

'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Robert Kiyosaky On Why Jeff Bezos Is Taking On Elon Musk,2021-09-27 19:57:28+00:00,Adrian Zmudzinski,"Robert Kiyosaki — the author of bestselling financial education book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" — shared with his mailing list subscribers what one of his trusted experts believes to be a bigger opportunity than Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was in its early days.
See Also: BEST ROBERT KIYOSAKI BOOKS 
What Happened: Kiyosaki said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has started selling stock at a much faster pace than before — largely to finance a new endeavor that he himself describes as ""the most important thing I'm doing right now.""
In 2017, Bezos said that he would sell only $1 billion of stock per year, but in 2020 he sold over $10.2 billion and in 2021 he has already sold $5.1 billion.
Kiyosaki-promoted entrepreneur, investor and hedge fund manager James Altucher expects that more about the project will be revealed at an Oct. 19 conference. This endeavor places Bezos in direct competition with Elon Musk's Starlink global internet service powered by a vast low-orbit satellite constellation. 
Altucher's analysis points out Amazon's patent grant #10556709, which describes an energy-efficient system capable of launching payloads into orbit at high speeds. A maritime that would use the principles of whip dynamics to move a cable with one or multiple aerial vehicles attached to ""create, propagate, and accelerate a whip waveform along the cable toward the payload."" This would — in principle — accelerate the payload enough to reach orbit.

Rising Oil Prices and Yields Makes Market Navigation More Complex,2021-10-05 14:45:46+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Bitcoin (/BTC) topped $50,000 this morning for the first since May, but traders may be more focused on oil prices and yields. Crude oil (/CL) is continuing its rise as futures traded more than 1% higher before the market open. When looking for inflation, gas prices are one of the first places people feel it, so rising oil prices are an important indicator in today’s environment.
Rising oil prices appear to be pulling yields higher as the 10-year Treasury Index (TNX) is testing 1.5% again this morning. Higher yields can often help Financial stocks.
Currently, rising oil prices and interest rates aren’t deterring stocks because the major indices futures are pointing to a higher open as well. But we’ve seen this movie before, the bulls get an early start on the day but are often overwhelmed by the bears later. 
PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is giving the bulls a reason to be positive after announcing better-than-expected profit and revenue and then raised its guidance for the next year. The company has been able to navigate supply chain issues and believes it’ll continue to do so going forward.
If consumers can focus on services instead of products, the supply chains could find some relief. After the open investors will have a chance to see if the service sector is coming back. The ISM Non-Manufacturing report will be released this morning.
The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM) tracks TD Ameritrade client investing behavior. In September, the IMX reflected that clients were net buyers of equities and fixed-income assets. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Ford (NYSE: F), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) were among the buying targets. At the same time, clients took advantage of rising prices to sell Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), Delta (NYSE: DAL), and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).
Technically Speaking

Ahead Of Captain Kirk's Flight To The Edge Of Space: 5 Things You Probably Didn't Know About William Shatner,2021-10-09 13:32:43+00:00,Phil Hall,"Real life will imitate reel life on Oct. 12 when William Shatner, best known as Captain Kirk in the “Star Trek” franchise, will travel to the edge of space as a passenger on a Blue Origin rocket – alas, without Jeff Bezos, the former Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO who also launched Blue Origin.
However, there is much more to Shatner’s career than “Star Trek.” Here are five fun facts that you may not know about the 90-year-old Canadian-born actor.
1. A First Break, Courtesy Of Christopher Plummer. In 1956, Shatner landed work as Christopher Plummer’s understudy in the lead of Shakespeare’s “Henry V,” which was being staged by Canada’s Stratford Festival. During the run, Plummer was hospitalized with a kidney stone and Shatner was tapped to go on stage.
Serendipitously, a few prominent critics were in the audience for Shatner’s performance and he was favorably reviewed. Plummer would later recall in his memoir “In Spite of Myself” that Shatner sought to put an original stamp on the role rather than imitate his performance.
“Shatner made sure he did everything I didn’t do – stood up where I had sat down, lay down where I stood up,” he wrote. “He was original to the last. I knew then that the SOB was going to be a star.”
Shatner would later admit that his handling of the role was largely based on ignorance, noting that while he memorized the part, he never rehearsed the physical aspects of the performance.
“I knew the lines, but I’d never said the words out loud,” Shatner said. “I didn’t know the blocking. I didn’t know whether to stand or sit.”
2. Captain Kirk Meets Batman. In 1964, Shatner was tapped to play the title role in a proposed series on the life of Alexander the Great, ...",News|Media,,https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/10/23301056/ahead-of-captain-kirks-flight-to-the-edge-of-space-5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-william-sh

Kimberly-Clark's Earnings Remind Investors that Inflation and Supply Chain Issues are Still a Major Theme,2021-10-25 15:07:02+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"This week is a big one for earnings, not just because of the big names reporting but because of the large number of earnings announcements. Investors can expect the themes of higher costs and supply chain issues to continue.
According to data from FactSet, 23% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their third-quarter earnings and 84% of them have beat Wall Street expectations. Earnings for the S&P 500 companies are on pace to grow more than 32% in the third quarter.
Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) is down nearly 3% in premarket trading after missing on earnings estimates and lowering its remaining 2021 outlook. In a statement by the company, cost issues were perpetrated specifically by “significant inflation and supply chain” disruptions.  
Outside of the earnings news, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) fell nearly 15% before the bell after PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported that it isn’t interesting “at this time” in acquiring the company.  PayPal is up more than 5% on the news.
Bloomberg reported this morning that whistleblower documents reveal that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is losing ground with teenagers and young adults. The stock was down 1% in premarket trade. Facebook is one of the S&P 500’s mega-cap tech stocks that report earnings this week. Facebook, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: APPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) have a combined market capitalization that makes up about 25% of the S&P 500. So, these earnings announcements can be market moving.  
Analysts at Citi (NYSE: C), downgraded Carnival Cruise (NYSE: CCL) to a “sell” rating. Analysts said that there was very little upside left for the company. The stock was down 1.3% in premarket trading.  
Former President Donald Trump’s new SPAC Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ: DWAC) is up more than 12% before the open. The company that has yet to launch a product rallied 107% on Friday.

Market Breadth Could Be a Liability as Stocks Struggle to Maintain Highs,2021-10-28 15:18:41+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Equity futures are slightly higher ahead of the open despite yesterday’s selloff into the close. Investors are sifting through another swarm of earnings, but the big headliners will come after the close today when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) report.
Investors will be looking to see if Apple can deliver phones for Christmas in light of the chip shortage. And, Amazon’s cloud business could be in focus as the “work from home” cloud business was good for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) but disappointing for IBM (NYSE: IBM).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) is pointing higher ahead of the open with components Merck and Caterpillar announcing positive earnings. Drug company Merck (NYSE: MRK) reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings prompting it to rally 1.85% before the opening bell. The company also raised its full-year outlook for earnings as the success of its new cancer drug continues to help the company grow.
Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) is also higher in premarket trading after beating earnings estimates despite missing revenue. The company appears to be able to navigate higher costs because of the higher number of orders. However, the company is cautious and stressed that there could be trouble in meeting the orders. Despite the caution, Cat Financial reported 110% increase in the division’s earnings because lending remains solid.
Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) beat earnings as well thanks to growth in broadband and recovery in its Universal Studios theme parks. The stock was up 3.6% in premarket trading.
On the negative side, e-commerce firm Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) is down 3.6% before the open in response to missing on earnings and revenue. The company reported issues with the global supply chain, but also lower e-commerce growth. This could be a sign that consumers are changing their focus from online shopping to other avenues.
Also, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS/A) is down 4% in premarket trading after the oil company missed on earnings. The company cited costs related to damages from Hurricane Ida in the U.S. as a reason for the miss. The company is also setting tougher emissions targets for itself which could add to its growing costs.
Crude oil (/CL) is falling a little as Iran rejoins the nuclear talks. Lower prices could provide some relief for transports, particularly airlines where fuel is such a large expense.

How Amazon Stock Looks Headed Into The Q3 Earnings Print,2021-10-28 15:19:39+00:00,Melanie Schaffer,"Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) is set to print its third-quarter 2021 earnings after the closing bell Thursday. When the tech giant reported its second-quarter revenue miss on July 29, the stock gapped down 7% the following day, and the gap has yet to be filled. 
In terms of guidance for the third-quarter, Amazon projected third quarter revenues to come in between $106 billion to $112 billion, which would represent a 10% to 16% year-over-year increase. Wall Street analysts predict revenues will come in at the top of the range with a $111-billion consensus estimate.
Unlike many of its FAANG counterparts, Amazon has lagged the markets this year — rising just 4.5% since the beginning of January compared to the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), which has soared about 21% higher.

Apple and Amazon are a Drag on Stocks as Big Tech Fail to Impress,2021-10-29 14:19:45+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"This week was supposed to be about big tech and technology but it’s really been about shortages and supply chain problems. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) disappointed investors because of their inability to get products to consumers. This raised concerns about whether brick-and-mortar stores can meet holiday demand. Right now, it’s a cloudy picture.  
One of the most anticipated earnings announcements finally came Thursday after the close when Apple announced better-than-expected earnings but lower-than-expected revenue due to lower sales. Apple has been telegraphing that sales would be a problem due to supply chain issues and component factory shutdowns in China over energy shortages. However, the stock still traded 3.4% lower in after-hours trading.
Another highly anticipated report came from Amazon, which was down more than 4% in after-hours trading after missing on earnings and revenue. The company was hurt by product shortages, higher wage costs, higher shipping expenses, and operational investments, but it also emphasized that it’ll do “whatever it takes” to ensure a good holiday season. However, Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing platform, grew by 39%.
Are the FAANG stocks going to have to change their acronym? First, Google changed to Alphabet, and now Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is changing its name to Meta. The new name is meant to reflect the company’s goal on metaverse and not just the Facebook social media app. The metaverse includes other social media apps like Instagram, Oculus, and WhatsApp. The company is also changing its stock symbol to “MVRS” starting December 1.
Outside of technology, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) beat on top- and bottom-line estimates but still traded 3.83% lower in after-hours trading. The company continues to feel the negative effects of the pandemic and continues to be hurt by sales in China. Continued COVID-19 outbreaks in China are slowing down consumer spending.
However, the Energy sector is in focus Friday morning as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announce better-than-expected earnings and revenue.

What Happened:  Laura Schwab, who was vice president of sales and marketing at Rivian, has alleged she was “abruptly” fired after she complained about the company’s “toxic bro culture” and facing gender discrimination from a top executive.
The lawsuit says the electric vehicle maker violated the state’s labor code, tarnished Schwab’s reputation and caused emotional pain.

Producers Look to Pass on Rising Costs to Consumers,2021-11-10 15:58:32+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Today’s news starts with inflation information. Inflation numbers were released for China and the United States. China reported that inflation on the producer level hit a 26-year high to 13.5%. In contrast, the U.S. Producer Price Index came in at 8.6% on Tuesday. One of the largest impacts of China’s rising prices was rising energy costs.
China also reported that consumer prices rose 1.5% reaching a 13-month high. Rising costs in food and fuel were big drivers. However, China uses price controls and subsidies to reduce consumer prices. This means Chinese companies may have to take the brunt of the costs which could reduce their profitability. Chinese price controls on commodities and raw materials could also result in shortages for the country as foreign producers may funnel products to other countries willing to pay the higher prices.
The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in much higher than expected at 0.6% instead of the 0.4% forecasted for the month of October. Annual inflation was expected to be at 5.8% but was actually 6.2%. Core CPI was up 4.6%, but inflation was pretty much hotter across the board. The 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) rallied 1.49% on the news in premarket trading.
The CPI reported a 30% increase in energy prices. Oil had already rallied on Tuesday after the API Weekly Crude Oil Stock report came in much lower than expected. Later today the Energy Information Administration (EIA) will provide its short-term energy outlook. The White House is already getting pressure to release strategic petroleum reserves to help curb prices.
In light of the inflation news, Friday’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment report may garner more attention as investors look to see what consumers’ thoughts are on rising inflation and how it might affect their behavior.  
Stock index futures were a little soft before the announcement and were a little moved on the news.
Outside of the CPI report, a couple of stocks were making moves. DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) rose 17% in premarket trading after reporting plans to buy Finnish company Wolt for $8.1 billion. Wolt operates in 23, mostly European, countries. The news appears to have investors shrugging off the company’s miss on earnings.
RingCentral (NYSE: RNG) is also up ahead of the bell. The company rose more than 25% on better-than-expected earnings and revenue. RingCentral announced a partnership with communications company Mitel. Barron’s reported that RingCentral will pay $650 million to acquire Mitel’s intellectual property and patents related to network and call management, security, and infrastructure.

Metaverse: A Quick Intro for Investors,2021-11-17 16:00:09+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Retailers continue to attract attention from investors with more earnings announcements. Before Wednesday’s open, Lowe’s (NYSE: LOW) and Target (NYSE: TGT) both announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue. However, Lowe’s rose nearly 4% in premarket trading while Target fell 3.5%. Similar performances occurred on Tuesday when Home Depot (NYSE: HD) rallied 5.7% on better-than-expected earnings, but Walmart (NYSE: WMT) fell 2.6% despite beating its earnings estimates.
The difference between Lowe’s and Target appears to be in the profit margins. Lowe’s reported expanding margins because it’s able to pass on price increases to consumers and has also benefitted from falling lumber prices. However, Target is getting pinched on its margins and may have to try and pass more costs on to consumers.
Online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) said it would stop accepting Visa cards issued in the U.K. because of the higher fees. Visa (NYSE: V) was 3% lower before the bell on the news but Amazon’s shares were relatively unchanged.  
In EV news, Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) was up 4.65% in premarket trading building on yesterday’s 23.71%. Investors appeared to welcome Lucid’s 2022 production goals. The company’s market cap has now surpassed both General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) despite only delivering a few hundred cars per year. Canoo (NASDAQ: GOEV) was also up 17.5% before the bell adding to its Tuesday rally of 23.67%. Canoo hopes to start delivering cars in 2022 on a limited basis. However, Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) was down about 8% in premarket trading despite rising more than 15% on Tuesday. After Tuesday’s close, Rivian was up more than 70% from its IPO five days ago.
In other market news, Credit Suisse analysts designated Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Qualcomm (QCOM) as “outperforming” on Tuesday. The high rating helped prompt 1% and 7.9% rallies in the stocks respectively. Cloud growth and semiconductor demand are helping to prompt higher ratings.

Fed News: Investors Waiting on New Chair Nominee & Taper Update,2021-11-22 15:11:24+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"Stocks appear to be shrugging off increased pandemic restrictions in Europe because the equity index futures are pointing to higher open sparked by the positive tone set in European markets. It appears to be a positive tone on a holiday week. As usual, the market will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and then open for a half-day on Friday. This commonly results in lighter volume throughout the week so investors should be careful trading and consider smaller position sizes.
This morning President Biden renominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell to maintain his position at the Federal Reserve. While a few Democrats have already spoken out against the nomination, it’s likely that Powell will see bi-partisan support because of Powell’s Republican background.
Speaking of the Fed, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in a speech last week that the Fed may need to taper faster. The comments appear to be strengthening the dollar. A quicker taper could result in an interest rate hike sooner than expected.
EV makers continue to make news. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was up 2.4% in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk tweeted about the possibility of the Model S Plaid being available to customers in China this spring. Tesla has boasted that the luxury model is the fastest production car they have ever built but hasn’t been available for customers in China. Competitors Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) were down 5% and 3% respectively before the bell.
Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) is down 1.23% in premarket trading on news that the CEO Bobby Kotick would consider leaving the company if he can’t fix corporate culture issues. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Kotick didn’t inform the board’s directors about misconduct reports that included one rape accusation.
Potential Tax Troubles
This year’s stock market losers could see additional volatility because it’s tax-loss harvesting season. This is the time when many investors choose to sell their losers to recognize the loss for tax purposes and then if they so choose, they can buy the stocks back 30 days later. The losses have the potential to offset some capital gains taxes, up to $3,000, and potentially reduce a person’s tax burden. Of course, TD Ameritrade does not provide tax advice, but, if you think this is a strategy you’d like to consider learning more about, talk to your tax advisor to determine if tax-loss harvesting would work for you and your portfolio. 
One other potential volatility contributor is that many folks may want to take profits where they can as we go into year-end. The reason why is because of potential changes in tax laws.

Investors Shunning Bonds Despite 3-day Losing Streak Suggests,2021-12-21 15:06:07+00:00,JJ Kinahan,"S&P Index futures (/ES) were trading 1% higher in premarket trading as stocks look to rebound from Monday’s selloff. The tech appears to be set to lead as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (/NQ) were up 1.21% before the open which was being bolstered by semiconductor maker Micron (MU). Micron rallied 6.38% in after-hours trading on Monday. The company announced that it topped Wall Street earnings estimates and increased expectations due to a 70% increase in data-center sales for its cloud enterprise products. Micron continued to climb in premarket trading reaching an increase of 8.79%. 
In other tech news, Citrix (CTXS) was up nearly 9% in premarket trading on news that Elliott Investment Management and Vista Equity Partners are considering a joint bid for the company.  
Consumer staples were the top performer in Monday’s selloff but they’re starting the day with some bad news. Cereal maker General Mills (NYSE: GIS) reported a miss on earnings estimates. The stock fell 1.80% in premarket trading. General Mills saw operating profits fall by 13% due to inflation and supply chain issues. However, they did raise their sales outlook.
General Mills isn’t the only company still having supply chain issues. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is reporting that it will only sell small orders of their signature French fries in Japan for the next week because of a supply shortage. A flood in a Vancouver port and COVID-10-related labor shortages are causing the shortage in fries. Investors appeared unconcerned about the development because the stock was up 0.71% in premarket trading.
After Monday’s close, Nike (NYSE: NKE) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, climbing 3.55% in after-hours trading. Tight supply lines have the company continuing to cut ties with retailers so the company can focus on sales in their own stores. Nike has recently ended partnerships with DSW, which is one of the largest shoe stores in the United States and a subsidiary of Designer Brands (NYSE: DBI). In 2019, Nike ended its relationship with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
Investors may be getting into a speculative mood. The VIX (Cboe Market Volatility Index) was down 4.63% in premarket trading falling below 22 in premarket trading. The Russell 2000 Index futures (/RTY) rallied 1.22% before the bell. Additionally, cryptocurrencies that have recently been correlated with “risk on” investments are seeing rallies as well. Bitcoin futures (/BTC) are up 3.87% ahead of the open. These could be good signs for stocks after a three-day losing streak.

Stock Wars: Netflix Vs. Lionsgate,2021-12-22 17:25:09+00:00,Phil Hall,"Benzinga’s weekly Stock Wars matches up two leaders in a major industry sector with the goal of determining which company is the better investment.
This week, the duel is between two high-profile entertainment industry companies: Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LGF-A).
The Case For Netflix: This company was founded in 1997 by tech industry entrepreneurs Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings in Scotts Valley, California, as an online DVD rental store. Within a year of its launch, Randolph and Hastings received an acquisition offer from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, which was rejected. The company weathered the trauma of the dot-com bubble meltdown and competition from Blockbuster LLC, which Netflix sued for patent infringement.
Netflix began to move into original content production in 2006 and streaming in 2007. Over the years, the company de-emphasized the DVD rental side of its operations — although it was never completely shuttered — and played up its streaming endeavors by partnering with major studios while producing its own content. Netflix won its first Emmy Award in 2013 for the series “House of Cards” and branched into the theatrical release side of the business, winning its first Academy Award in 2019 with Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma.”
Today, Netflix’s streaming entertainment service has more than 209 million paid memberships in over 190 countries.
In the past few months, the company was the center of a brief controversy over protests by transgender activists over jokes made by Dave Chapelle in his Netflix special “Closer,” and it generated a surprise global sensation with the Korean-produced “Squid Game” along with an equally surprising flop when the much-ballyhooed live-action adaptation of the anime series “Cowboy Bebop” was canceled shortly after the premiere of its first season. The company is also generating industry buzz for the next Academy Awards competition for its titles “The Power of the Dog,” “Passing,” “The Hand of God,” “Don’t Look Up,” “The Lost Daughter,” “tick…tick…BOOM!” and “The Harder They Fall.”

In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the third-quarter data published Oct. 19, Netflix recorded $7.5 billion in revenue, a 16% increase from the $6.4 billion level from one year earlier, and a net income of $1.4 billion versus $790 million in the previous year.

Given their heavy weightings in the index, these companies' stocks have the potential to sway the market in one particular direction.

A downtrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of lower lows and lower highs on the chart.
The lower lows indicate the bears are in control while the intermittent lower highs indicate consolidation periods. Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend and descending longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicating a long-term downtrend.
A stock often signals when the lower low is in by printing a reversal candlestick such as a doji, bullish engulfing or hammer candlestick.
