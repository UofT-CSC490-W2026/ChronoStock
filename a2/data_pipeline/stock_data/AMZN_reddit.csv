Submission,2021-04-26 09:59:58,noveltieaccount,7,I've been reading Nick Sleep's Investor Letters and I can't Understand how he valued amazon,"I would highly recommend that everyone here read Nick's Sleep's investor letters. I first heard about these letters mentioned in an interview that Mohnish Pabrai gave. Nick Sleep is a value investor and I think his letters are full of very valuable insights: [https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf](https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf)  One of Nick Sleep's biggest and most profitable investments was in Amazon. From the letters, I believe that he started to build a position in Amazon starting around 2005. He doesn't give specifics around his valuation methodology for Amazon, so I decided to go back and look at Amazon's 10-K from 2007 and try to figure out how one could have valued the company at that time. [https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_AMZN_2007.pdf](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_AMZN_2007.pdf)  As I see it, in 2007 the basic math for the company was this: they are growing sales at a steady rate of 20% per year and their profit margins are 3% (not bad for retail). Their market cap was $39 billion and they made $15 billion in sales in 2007. With a 3% margin, this $15 billion translates to something like $450 million in income.  If I assume that Amazon continues to execute flawlessly and grows sales at a 20% compounding rate for the next 5 years, my sales end up $37 billion and income at $1.1 billion (assuming 3% margins).  This means that in 2007 you were buying $1 of Amazon profits for $82 and if you assume they continue to execute perfectly over 5 years, they are still at a P/E of 35.  I know you could use FCF instead of profits, but even that doesn't help much. FCF ends up around $1billion in 2007, so you are still talking about a P/FCF of 40. Also, for Amazon at the time the capital expenditures that are subtracted for the FCF are needed for their growth, so it actually doesn't seem appropriate to me to deduct the capex and then build a model with assumed growth.  Looking back we all know what happened. They continued to grow and it happened not just over a 5 year period, but a 15 year period and Amazon is still growing today. But I just find it so hard to make something like a 15 year growth projection. There are so many things that could go wrong! Even making a 5 year growth projection seems like a complete stab in the dark. How could anyone looked at the price of Amazon between 2005 and 2007 in a rational way and believed that it would have provided good returns?",https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/myyb8e/ive_been_reading_nick_sleeps_investor_letters_and/
Submission,2021-06-03 20:34:52,Michael_Therami,2,Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : Ready to Test 2021 High Again as Q1 Earnings Report Approaches (June 24th),"As Rite Aid ( RAD ) approaches its fiscal Q1 earnings report date of June 24, 2021, will the stock approach its recent high of $32.48 attained back in January of this year?  **Some Basic Information**  * Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders. * There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy. * The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year. * Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion. * The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January. * The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year. * The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion * Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year. * Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle. * Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens. * In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today. * Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )  **Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**  One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.  At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A &amp; B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.  Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.  **Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**  While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.  Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  * Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability * All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  That being said, today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid and made the following statement:  ***""Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***  And finally, a potential dark horse suitor has emerged...or re-emerged, I should say.  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( WBA ) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen ( ABC ) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal. With that $6.5 billion windfall, Walgreens is now is a position to purchase the remainder of Rite Aid, finally completing the acquisition that it set out to accomplish way back in 2015. Such an acquisition would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  \* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS  \* Providing Walgreens with a PBM to help it gain share in the prescription drug market and become more competitive in that segment  \* Blocking both Amazon and Walmart from acquiring Rite Aid as part of their pharmacy strategy which would quickly catapult either company into the position of 3rd largest retail pharmacy in the USA  The race appears to be on to see who will ultimately acquire Rite Aid!  **Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**  Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. I personally believe that the stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.  NOTE: I am NOT a financial advisor or investment professional. I have not formal education in investing or finance.  \[OP's Position in RAD: I own the followng long positions in RAD:  * 80 June $26 strike calls * 200 July $28 strike calls * 50 LEAPS at various strike prices \]",https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nrsd9p/rite_aid_rad_ready_to_test_2021_high_again_as_q1/

This report is purely for entertainment purposes and should not be considered investment advice. Do your own research and due diligence.**  Hello again, everyone.  After my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nhhov7/cruise_ship_stocks_fundamental_comps_analysis/) of cruise ship stocks, it was refreshing to pour through companies with such strong financials. However, with healthy income statements and balance sheets come high, perhaps overly optimistic valuations. I expected that the stock price of most of these companies would be completely divorced from their near-future expected financials, and I was mostly correct, but there are still a couple of buying opportunities I am excited to share.  After analyzing a list of some of the strongest e-commerce players in the world, I found 2 companies where I believed there is a value opportunity: Alibaba and eBay.  I had expected any Alibaba buying opportunity to have been completely swallowed given that every analysis, comment, and post I see about the stock is centered around how now is a great time to buy and how many institutions are buying, but the stock is still at a level where I would consider buying.  The opportunity which suits me and my portfolio better, and the one which I have provided some additional DD on is, eBay. I won't spoil too much, but I was really excited to dive into this company, and everything I found made me lean more into buying. I was able to discover what I consider to be compelling evidence that the company is undervalued, why the stock is undervalued, and reason to believe that the price will rise to fair value in the near-term. I made a purchase of eBay stock after my research, and I do not own any of the other companies listed. I purchased the stock at the beginning of the week, and it has had a fortunate run-up since then, but the difference between the price today and my fair value estimate, $65 -&gt; $71 does not hit as hard as $60 -&gt;71.  A quick note on my DD. I don't often put this sort of research down on paper, so this is halfway (at most) between a competent report and stream-of-consciousness research. If I wanted to look into something, I went and did it, then took down the notes and worried about formatting almost not at all. If anything is unclear, spelled wrong, or doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll go edit. I did some editing of course, but I might've missed something!  **Model**  [**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing)  **My Due Diligence on eBay**  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing)  **Methodology**:  * Created a three-statement model for Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Shopify Inc., Amazon. com Inc., JD .com Inc., Sea Limited, MercadoLibre Inc., eBay Inc., and Walmart Inc., * Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach * Spread comparable companies (the companies listeD) * Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at fair value estimates  **How to use the model**  * Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first * To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here * I have tried to supply useful assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs * WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly * Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases. * For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results. * Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them * If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!  **Other Notes:**  * Some of these companies have assumptions that I have baked in which should be scrutinized. I would highly recommend against jumping straight to the DCF/val matrix and instead take some time to adjust the assumptions. You may not agree with my findings and theses (plural for thesis?) so play safe! * The 2 irl people I showed my work to asked me to rank the companies in order of which stocks I like the most. For me, the value-based &amp; forward-looking rankings are 1. EBAY 2. BABA 3.AMZN 4. WMT 5. SHOP 6. JD 7. SE 8. MELI * JMIA was considered for the list, but the financials the company publishes are lacking in depth, and I get a little squeamish when a company has ""technologies"" in its name, so I let it go. Jumia is a very interesting company though, worth looking into if you're not afraid of some sovereign/political risk. * MELI appears to have a shorter payables turnover than receivables. Thumbs down. * I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP * Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up.

The company has benefited from the pandemic and will continue to reinvest aggressively to continue growing rapidly. They will expand and disrupt new markets and continue using their dominance and scale to drive lower costs and benefit from massive economies of scale. But, their size has put a target on their back, and meaningful antitrust regulation could be just around the corner.*  Market Price = $3,366   Estimated Value = $2,805   Price/Value = 120%   Monte-Carlo Price Percentile = 59%   Rating At Current Price = HOLD  \--  #### The Company  Amazon is an American multinational technology company focused primarily on eCommerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company operates a marketplace for consumers, sellers, and content creators. It offers merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers.  The company has six business segments:  1. **Online Stores** — *51% of Revenue* — Offer consumer products through online stores, including fulfilment and shipping. 2. **Physical Stores** — *4% of Revenue* — Offer consumer products through physical stores. 3. **Third-Party Seller Services** — *21% of Revenue* — Offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in Amazon stores and fulfil orders through Amazon. Receives a commission and fulfilment and shipping fees. 4. **Subscription Services** — *7% of Revenue* — Includes fees from Amazon Prime memberships, access to content including digital video, audiobooks, music, e-books and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single obligation. 5. **Amazon Web Servers** — *12% of Revenue* — Includes global sales of computing, storage, database, and other services. Certain services, including compute and database, are offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term. 6. **Other** — *6% of Revenue* — Primarily advertising services.  The company has expanded into new business segments over time, but it remains, primarily, an online retailer.  [Amazon is still, primarily, an online retailer.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa85629d1-3f66-4c83-9436-0e54112d8070_1692x806.png)  Despite being a multinational company, Amazon still gets the majority of its revenues from the United States. In fact, \~90% of its revenues come from just four countries: The US, Germany, The UK and Japan.  [Despite being a multinational, Amazon still gets the vast majority of revenue from the US.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43c930fa-4e78-45fb-8aba-324212995b10_1692x806.png)  Amazon is the world’s largest online marketplace, artificial intelligence assistant provider, and cloud-computing platform by revenue. Moreover, it is the largest Internet company and the second-largest private-sector employer in the US.  The company is known for disrupting well-established industries by applying technological innovation at a massive scale. Amazon enables authors, musicians, filmmakers, app developers, and others to publish and sell content via its branded websites.  Amazon also provides Kindle Direct Publishing, an online platform that allows independent authors and publishers to make their books available in the Kindle Store. In addition, the сompany offers co-branded credit card agreements and advertising services, serves developers and enterprises through Amazon Web Services, and manufactures and sells electronic devices.  The company owns over 40 subsidiaries, including Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Ring, Shopbop, Twitch, and Whole Foods Market. It distributes various downloadable and streaming content through its Prime Video, Music, Twitch, and Audible subsidiaries.  \--  #### The Timeline  Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in his garage in Bellevue, Washington, in July 1994. He started the company as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded into electronics, video games, software, furniture, food, toys, and jewellery.  * 1994 — Jeff Bezos founds Amazon. * 1997 — IPO at $18/share. Launches second distribution centre. * 1998 — Acquires IMDb and expands into CDs and DVDs. * 1999 — Expands into toys and secures 1-click patent. * 2002 — Starts selling clothes. * 2003 — Launches AWS. * 2005 — Amazon Prime launched. * 2006 — AmazonFresh launched. * 2007 — Kindle launched. * 2008 — Acquires Audiobooks company which becomes Audible. * 2011 — Kindle Fire launched to Enter the tablet market. * 2014 — Launches smartphones and acquires Twitch ($970M). * 2015 — Amazon Echo becomes widely available. * 2017 — Whole Foods acquisition ($13.7B). * 2018 — Acquires Ring ($839M) and passes $1T market capitalisation. * 2021 — Acquires MGM ($8.45B).  Jeff Bezos, who has led the company since he founded it, stood down as CEO in February this year and announced that he would transition to Executive Chair of the Board. Andy Jassy, who is currently the CEO of AWS, is set to take over from Jeff.  The company has been heavily criticised for its practices, including surveillance overreach, demanding and competitive working conditions, potential tax avoidance and potentially anti-competitive behaviour. As Amazon has grown, it has become an enormous target for regulatory agencies and antitrust suits.  &gt;*“Last week saw the filing of two more such suits, claiming the Seattle-based e-commerce giant’s policies drive up prices. Those cases bring the number of antitrust actions lodged against Amazon since last March to at least 16.”*   — Katherine Anne Long, [Private antitrust suits stack up against Amazon, mirroring federal scrutiny](https://archive.is/CbDLp), The Seattle Times, 2-Aug-2021  \--  #### The Financials  Amazon is one of those businesses that feel like it’s simultaneously been around forever but also just started up. That’s probably because it is. It only took Jeff Bezos 24 years to take Amazon from garage start-up to trillion-dollar company. Mind-blowing! Especially when compared to Apple, which was founded in 1976 and beat Amazon to a trillion by a matter of weeks.  [The Amazon sprint from IPO to $1T company.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37661c25-ed0c-4e7a-af5b-1756b80852f2_2400x1163.png)  After a barely noticeable market capitalisation in 1996, Amazon took off during the dot-com boom. Still, as the bubble collapsed, the company lost \~80% of its capitalisation in 2000 alone as capital markets dried up for tech companies.  This was not good news for the rapidly expanding but loss-making Amazon, which needed access to capital. After this near-death experience, Amazon spent *all* of the following two decades continuing to expand and grow.  [Year after year, Amazon continues to grow.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e50031-efa8-43e3-b39e-5a840b7b3bb9_2400x1167.png)  The company's growth was other-worldly in the early years, partly because it was a tiny start-up with less than a million dollars in revenues in 1995, partly because of Bezos’s growth ambitions. Revenues reach $2.76 billion by 2020, and the TTM to Q2 2021 were over $443B.  [Growth was stratospheric in the early years. But, impressively, it has stayed high ever since.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48605a31-8023-439a-b7a0-1de2bd9181a5_2400x1157.png)  One of the impressive things about Amazon is that it has maintained an incredibly high growth rate despite its increasing size. Typically, the larger a company gets, the harder it becomes to grow at a meaningful clip. Amazon has defied this with their willingness to reinvest virtually all operating profits, acquire new businesses, and expand into almost any line of business imaginable.  Amazon has *never* registered a TTM period with revenues lower than the last. In fact, the slowest twelve-month period of growth for Amazon was 2001, when they grew at a *pathetic* 13%.  [Amazon has never registered a period of negative growth.](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98288136-d47b-4497-ba46-39b7c928c6b0_2400x1163.png)  However, on the income front, the story has not been as positive. While enormous operating losses in the ‘90s are explained by the company being a young growth company, it became increasingly difficult to justify these losses into the early ‘00s. In fact, Amazon was still registering operating losses six years after its IPO.  Further, rather than operating margins improving over time as the economies-of-scale kick in, which is what you would expect in growth companies, Amazon's margins have not only stayed low but have periodically declined. This suggests that either the company is not reaping the benefits of scale or is operating with a very different agenda and sees maturity at a scale far beyond anything we could previously have imagined.  \--  #### The Previous Valuation - October 2020  When [I valued Amazon in October last year](https://valuabl.substack.com/p/valuation-amazoncom-inc), I told a story about an enormous online retailer investing everything in growth. I said that they would continue to grow rapidly but that their businesses would start to mature and see the benefits of the enormous scale.  Further, I suggested that this scale would help them keep costs low and earn above industry profit margins. I said that they could use these profits, along with their enormous data troves, to continuing acquiring other companies in a successful and value-adding way.  However, I finished off by suggesting that Amazon could become a victim of its success and was likely to be the target of significant antitrust regulation and even a forced break-up.  I valued the shares around $2,600-$2,700 and assigned a ‘Reduce’ rating based on my Monte-Carlo simulation and the stock price of $3,200. Since then, the stock price has held up, and it currently trades around $3,300.  \--  #### The Story  *Amazon is the most feared disruptive platform in history. The company has benefited from the pandemic and will continue to reinvest aggressively to continue growing rapidly. They will expand and disrupt new markets and continue using their dominance and scale to negotiate lower costs and benefit from massive economies of scale. But, their size has put a target on their back, and meaningful antitrust regulation could be just around the corner.*  **Total Market** — Amazon is so massive and sprawling that it operates in six connected global markets that I have estimated are worth $26.8T in aggregate. I have listed them out [here](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c25d337-d61b-455b-94e5-5ad126929dcf_427x170.png).  We can see that economists expect the Digital Media, Cloud Web Servers and Digital Advertising markets to be the fastest-growing. In contrast, they expect the retail (both on and offline) and logistics markets to grow much more slowly.  When I weigh the market growth forecasts by Amazon’s segment weights, I get an expected Market CAGR for Amazon of 8.75%.  **x Market Share** — Amazon is a behemoth with access to deep pools of capital. The company has proven its willingness to spend and lose enormous sums to enter new markets and disrupt incumbents. Further, they are becoming increasingly acquisitive in recent years, especially in industries that border their own. Whole Foods and MGM are examples.  They’re currently *only* 1.8% of the aggregate global market, but this is more a reflection of how enormous these markets are, especially physical retail, than the company. However, if we ignore physical retail (\~4% of the company’s revenue), Amazon has a 5.7% market share in an $8.3T market that will grow at 9%. I think this is a more authentic reflection of the company’s position. I believe that Amazon will continue to reinvest aggressively to expand into new markets and countries and take market share.  **= Revenue** — I have modelled Amazon to grow at an 18% CAGR. This rate is at the lower end of their historical range but is higher than analyst consensus (17%). This growth rate implies that Amazon will achieve sales of $1.5T by 2030 and have almost 8% of their non-physical retail markets.  This assumption is not one I take lightly. Turning over that much in a single year is mind-boggling. It is \~$48k per second. It is the entire 2020 GDP of countries like Russia, Brazil, Australia or Spain. Turnover of $1.5T in 2030 would make Amazon 1.25% of 2030 Global GDP compared to the 0.55% it is currently.  But, the Amazon platform is becoming so ubiquitous that it is the primary, and often only, sales channel for many other companies — one that many businesses and customers can’t walk away from.  **Less: Costs** — I believe that Amazon will continue to use its dominant position to drive down costs and eventually raise prices. Moreover, when the company begins to mature and stabilise, the incredible economies of scale will reduce fixed costs as a percentage of the cost base.  **= Operating Income** — I have modelled for operating margins to continue growing from their current level (\~9.5% on an R&amp;D adjusted basis) and reach 13.50% by 2026. This would be almost double the weighted average of the company's industries (6.9% margins) and would result in a yearly NOPAT of nearly $150B by 2030.  The company has a regulatory target on its back that I believe inhibits margins from expanding much further. Significant price rises or margins getting much bigger would be massive red flags for global regulatory bodies and would encourage them to step in more aggressively.  **Less: Taxes** — I have modelled the company’s tax rate to rise from its current effective rate of \~12.4% to my estimate of its country-weighted rate of 26.82%. The company also has a $13.4 NOL tax shield.  **Less: Reinvestment** — The company is going to have to continue reinvesting huge sums. It currently produces $1.93 of sales from every dollar of invested capital. I have modelled for this to continue, resulting in over $530B of additional net capital poured into the business over the next ten years.  **= Free Cash Flows** — Based on the above, I have forecast that the company will remain FCF positive and won’t need to raise any additional capital.  **Adjust For: Time Value &amp; Risk** — Amazon is an online retail (51%), physical retail (4%), logistics (21%), entertainment (7%), cloud services (12%), and advertising (6%) business. It gets 69% of revenue from the US, 9% from Germany, 6% from the UK, 6% from Japan, and 11% from the rest of the world. The company has a 0.5x operating leverage ratio and a 7.1% D/E ratio.  Moody’s has assigned Amazon an A1/A+ rating and says:  &gt;“Amazon's ratings continue to recognize its powerful brand, which is synonymous with online retail throughout most of the world, as well as the strength and profitability of Amazon Web Services (""AWS""). AWS accounts for the majority of the company's operating income and free cash flow supporting Amazon's ability to make strategic investments in its retail operations. In addition to its leading competitive position in both online retail and web services, Amazon also has a solid ecosystem of entertainment content and a formidable third-party seller business.”   — [Moody’s Investor Services, 10 May 2021](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Amazon-to-A1--PR_445977)  I have gone with their rating. Usually, I would give a 1.08% chance of distress to companies with this rating based on the historical data. But, for Amazon, I have bumped this to 3% to accommodate for the chance of severe antitrust regulation forcing a breakup of the business or significantly inhibiting growth/profitability.  **Add: Non-Operating Assets** — $7.3B worth of investments carried at fair value.  **Less: Debts &amp; Other Claims** — $121B in debts and leasehold commitments.  \--  #### The Valuation  The company reports in USD and has its primary listing on the NASDAQ.

In fact, approximately 25% of subscribers were in India. India has emerged as a key battleground in the streaming wars with Netflix(NFLX), Amazon(AMZN), Disney(DIS), ViacomCBS(VIAC), and others, who are pouring resources to try to capture scale in this large and valuable market.  In India the number one streaming service is Hotstar (owned by Disney) accounting for 41% of the market and consisting of over 400 million users of their free with ads platform. For paid streaming, Hotstar had a total of 6 million users split between their VIP and Premium subscription plans when they were acquired by Disney. This number is growing now that they have been purchased by Disney(now almost 19 million about 25% of Disney+ users). Hotstar now offers all of the Disney+ content(called Disney+ Hotstar) as well as the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League (IPL) Cricket. To give you an idea of the popularity of cricket viewership in India, 411 million people watched the IPL championship in 2019.   In addition to IPL, Disney+ Hotstar has the rights to many popular shows in India including those from other US competitor networks such Game of Thrones, Friends, Modern Family as well as tons of Disney and Fox’s own movie content and 61 channels that are in 9 local languages. While this is more premium content than the American Disney+, Indian viewers pay the equivalent of around $5 for the VIP plan and $14 for the Premium plan for the full year as opposed to the US’s $6.99 per month plan or $69.99 per year, so the huge subscriber market is offset in part by the lower prices points. Similar to their approaches in the US, Disney has targeted a lower price point initially to quickly scoop up market share.

Submission,2021-09-10 10:39:39,weighingmachine,1,4 Key Takeaways From John Malone On Streaming Businesses,"John Malone is the CEO and Founder of Liberty Media a global broadcasting brand and pioneered the US cable business. Key takeaways from his talk on streaming as it applies Disney, Netflix, and all the rest. Quick summary:  1. Direct Customer Relationship vs. Content Strategies   With the big cable bundle dying, Malone highlights two main strategies for streaming companies. First, build a direct customer relationship - how many people do you already have a direct billing relationship with? Amazon(AMZN) and Apple(AAPL) are examples here because they already have their customers’ credit card numbers, emails, and other information.  The second strategy is the content strategy where you put efforts into building and acquiring the best content. Disney+(DIS) is a great example of this because of their rights to Marvel, Disney, Star Wars, Pixar, to name a few.   2. Optionality on timing and amount of investment into streaming for bundlers  Both Apple and Amazon could potentially buy another streaming service from a traditional media player and combine that arsenal of content with their user base.  3. Some might succeed in the niches  Possibly the best way for old media providers like ViacomCBS and DIscovery to survive is to focus on niche content.  4. International growth  As the US market becomes saturated with services, the companies that want to grow from tens of millions of subscribers to hundreds of millions of subscribers will need to look overseas.   full article  [https://www.prophits.app/post/4-key-takeaways-from-john-malone-on-streaming](https://www.prophits.app/post/4-key-takeaways-from-john-malone-on-streaming)",https://reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/plmd1k/4_key_takeaways_from_john_malone_on_streaming/

Good price to earnings, steady increasing revenue, buying back stock consistently, good balance sheet (low debt).  I saw eBay recently down there at a P/E ratio of 3.5; their revenue and profits are increasing steadily with time, they’re buying back a ton of stock, the balance sheet looks decent.  As far as my view of the company as a whole, being a member of the millennials, having used eBay many times, I don’t see anything wrong with them. They are and have been basically the same company for years — a market place for buyers and sellers..  I see them now as a smaller Amazon without a distribution network of their own.

Toss in another $5.5B of D&amp;A charges, and you're suddenly only looking at an EV/EBITDA multiple around 29x. While hardly cheap, it's hardly the 150x PE that it appears to have.   &amp;#x200B;  Looking at it from a DCF standpoint, if we assume 1) all earnings are reinvested 2) the business grows at just 10% over the next five years and 3) AMZN can be exited at a 15x EV/EBITDA multiple at the end of the five years you're looking at a base case of 14.25% annualized returns. Subtract your chosen discount rate from this annualized figure.   &amp;#x200B;  These are fairly conservative estimates IMO, especially the exit multiple. Amazon is a fantastic compounder of capital with a near-monopoly on a number of markets, and may well be worth more as a sum of the parts in the event of anti-trust action.

Comment,2021-04-06 12:38:10,dudetalking,1,,"Not everyone is meant to own stocks directly. If buying and holding stocks doesn't make you happy why do it?  What are you really after?  Ask yourself, do you enjoy researching stocks, learning about the business, listening to conference calls, reviewing financial statements. If you are not excited to do this, why put unnecessary pressure.  You may want to consider ETFs which are wonderful tools.  The best mindset you can have as an investor is to stop looking at the paper GAINS or LOSSES and daily stock prices and look at your invested capital.   The more capital you can commit in the long run you will win. Time and Patience are your allies.  Here is the approach I wish I took at 18. Take a look at 5 companies you would love to go work for for the next 20 years, and imagine you had an employee stock plan.   If you were hired by Microsoft would you worry about the stock price everyday?  No you would take your stock incentive plan and over 20 years would be extremely well off, or if you got a job at Goldman Sachs or Amazon. 20 years of acquiring GS or AMZN stock. This is how wealth is built. These companies will have bad and good years, but you stick with them and in the long run they will stick with you.    Pretend you are an employee and owner, and just commit to owning shares in the BUSINESS. Forget about the stock price.  Look at your cost of capital. How much money can you commit every year to buy a piece of that business, how much can you own in 20 years.  Over time you will know these companies better than their own employees or the junior analysts who cover the stock. You will understand their cycles, how the stock trades, when they are having lean years and why and you will become a shrewd buyer, scooping up stock when its weak.  Once you change your mindset you will want the stock price to go down, not up. Because you want to own the business, you want the earnings stream for yourself. You will not care about what Mr. Market thinks your company is worth you will care about how much capital you have in the company and what is your share of the earnings.

Comment,2021-04-17 06:37:11,MustNotFapBruh,5,,"I really like your research result and I definitely agree the 1v1 comparison cannot be fully replicated onto both markets since business model could still be slightly different. Let me give an example, Amazon is the leader in cloud computing and big data thus you can foresee they will be the ultimate winner in that regard (MSFT might also surpass them one day so Idk haha), you could also argue BABA is also the clear winner on the other side of the world so far, yet we have to think about: is having so much data in China is a good thing? Considering CCP might not like the fact that you own so much data so you might have control more information than them. Say face recognition and data Center etc. Let’s say BABA has more potential or faster growth rate than Amazon considering Amazon already is extremely big in terms of market cap, does it mean BABA is a better investment ? Yet BABA could exposed to more political or regulation risk under the management under CCP. So if I wanna invest in cloud industry and big data, Amazon might still be a safer bet, since your company could literally be turn into a national company if CCP doesn’t like you that much, then eventually you will know much of revenue will be given to national bank. We could keep in mind that many of us like Jack Ma including myself, which he always speak the truth and give motivation in the public, but that’s not the right approach running a business in China no matter you like it or not. So you are right, they are not exactly that same even though quite similar to some extent.  If you are nervous but think China might have faster growing market or certain stocks in China might have faster growth rate than USA, I’d suggest putting 50/50% of stocks on both side, or adjust on your own. Instead of all your assets in one region. Let’s say you put all in Dow Jones, but it’s breaking the historical high every day, the risk could be very high, as it might fall down quickly all of a sudden. Let’s say you put all in China, you could be nervous on China political risk and policy adjustment. So you could strike a better balance with this approach. At least this is what I have been starting to do lately for feeling better balance psychologically.  Meanwhile, I think Meituan is better than PDD, as they involved themselves with more industries and businesses thus have higher ceilings in case they do very well. PDD mostly focuses on agriculture products and e-commerce. For E-commerce, if for me personally, I would only pick one among the three including BABA, JD and PDD, since they are really very similar when it comes to the e-commerce and the new business community group buying. Yet I’d still put Meituan above all 3 of them. If just because I like the cloud from BABA, I’d put my money on AMZN or MSFT, without exposing myself into too much political risk.  For the RAYC, I’ve never heard of it actually because I’m not fond of Chinese ETF. Because I believe if it’s an ETF tracking the Chinese index, I believe the ETF will move very slowly. In my take, Chinese Market Index like ShangHai Composite won’t move up much in the future because they are so many regulations from the government, you could argue for Hang Seng Index as well. Sometimes my investing relatives or Fad and I just call it “Policy Market”, since whether the market go up and down could totally be affected Govt sudden policies. If you really like the Chinese market, you should invest in certain stocks instead. You can tell why most of the biggest Chinese company came to Hong Kong for IPO instead of doing it in their own ShangHai index. Picking certain stock actually means they still are exposed to policy market but great company will usually outperform in the long run so idc too much about it.   Hope this isn’t too long haha.",https://www.reddit.com/comments/msiud7/_/gutw5tq/

I highly recommend this video if you haven't seen it yet:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876ig2COw_U,https://www.reddit.com/comments/pn7k8s/_/hcw2knm/
Comment,2021-09-26 23:03:18,cotdt,2,,By growth rate Amazon should be the #1 company by market cap in some years. I agree they are cheap but BABA is like an even cheaper version of AMZN. People only look at P/E which is a very volatile number. You got to calculate the discounted cash flow.,https://www.reddit.com/comments/pvqbjp/_/hefgywj/
Comment,2021-09-29 15:02:26,ExtremelyQualified,5,,AMZN  Really there is no equal. Amazon is a business-building machine that not only builds new businesses for themselves but then sells the capabilities they develop to everyone else.  They’re one of the largest companies in the world and they’re growing earnings 30% y/y,https://www.reddit.com/comments/pxvk9z/_/her9sxi/
Comment,2021-12-28 06:39:34,Badlucktrader,1,,"I agree that FB is very weirdly valued, but the metaverse is far from being a certain cash cow yet. Where as electrification of the entire car industry is inevitable, and Tesla is leading the way IMO  To be on par with Amazon a P/E of 100 seems reasonable IMO. https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:AMZN/explorer/pe_ltm  2022 100 P/E will give a stock price in the range 900-1200 (depending on what EPS you expect).",https://www.reddit.com/comments/rp5j3c/_/hq9mmw1/
Comment,2021-12-28 19:17:39,MoistGochu,1,,In my view I think Google can continue to grow revenue around 30% year over year for at least 2 or 3 years.  I do expect the growth to slow down quite significantly beyond that (I personally wouldn't assume any of Google's side projects/businesses to be a significant contributor although they are pretty interesting and can be priced like call options).  The key difference for Google vs most other tech companies (Amazon is a good example of relentless share dilution [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding) ) is that their share count will continue to decrease as they buy back more shares than they issue through share based compensation (Just like Apple [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/shares-outstanding](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/shares-outstanding) and Microsoft [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/shares-outstanding](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/shares-outstanding) ).,https://www.reddit.com/comments/r0rtd2/_/hqcgzle/
Comment,2021-12-30 12:28:45,Spl00ky,9,,Amazon has always been considered overvalued. But that is because they continuously reinvest their earnings and try to enter new markets. You can see their EPS beginning to explode higher over the past few years  https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted,https://www.reddit.com/comments/rs45hr/_/hqki7yd/
Comment,2021-12-30 18:06:55,mjrkwerty,1,,"And so there are different lines of business within AMZN - one that's similar to Google and one that is not. Compare the distribution aspect of Amazon to a pureplay distribution and logistics company. I bet you'd find Amazon has some advantages there.  My point is - you're comparing apples and oranges. Inflationary pressure in software is very real. Labor is a very real cost component and very much impacted by inflation be it a software developer or warehouse worker especially in the current environment.  Capital Assets like trucks and other equipment can also be an inflationary hedge. So it's not always the worst thing to be capital intensive.  Long story short - anything leading the way in cloud is going to continue to grow (both Google and Amazon). The consumer shift to digital buying and home delivery of goods also isn't changing (Amazon). It's only going to continue to grow.  I actually think it's all the things you list about Amazon that give them an edge. They own so much of a consumer's life already particularly where the digital meets the physical.  On the other hand, you have Google - I'd still hold their stock but lets be honest, they kind of shit the bed a lot. There is absolutely nothing I am reading or seeing anywhere that tells me sell Amazon and buy Google.",https://www.reddit.com/comments/rs45hr/_/hqly8uv/
Comment,2021-12-31 04:57:32,WallabyUpstairs1496,3,,"Amazon is getting competition from all of those sectors  cloud: goog, msft  retail: wmrt,  streaming: disney, hbo, cbs, nbc, everyone  delivery: instacart, wlmart, costco,   online shopping: shopify, ali, walmrt, coscto,   But who integrates all of these?  AMZN is a bet on integration. They killed it before, but that's not a garuntee that they'll do it again. But their plans are impressive.",https://www.reddit.com/comments/rs45hr/_/hqnz92r/
Comment,2022-01-01 23:06:02,ExtremelyQualified,3,,"AMZN because it's a machine that makes Amazon-styled businesses. However the world changes in the next 50+ years, Amazon will change to find a way to sell something to that world.",https://www.reddit.com/comments/rtz0mr/_/hqw7jeb/
Comment,2022-01-12 22:47:08,MoneyRegard,1,,I'm not surprised Munger has doubled down on Alibaba.  BABA trades at a PE near 19 and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) trades near a PE of 64.  My only guess for why Buffett hasn't joined Munger is because Buffett won't invest in companies he doesn't understand.,https://www.reddit.com/comments/s1shm2/_/hsfygcz/
Comment,2022-02-03 19:09:51,Calm_Leek_1362,1,,"Ok, but amazon has tremendous return on invested capital, and they've been investing deeply. Regardless of short term price fluctuations, amzn is still a long term hold.   Maybe don't buy first thing tomorrow morning, but long term amazon is still fantastic. Aws runs over 1/3 of the internet.  Most consumers will buy anything they can't find locally from them, and they have built a logistics empire that has no compare.",https://www.reddit.com/comments/sjv8jn/_/hvhs792/
Comment,2022-02-08 17:40:05,Xillllix,1,,"Dude, no other company has as much growth as Tesla.   Net income now equal to AMZN, with a slowly rising CAPEX and fast growing operating margins.  Tesla should already be $2k. Why should they be valued less than Amazon with the same Net Income and 10-15x the yearly growth?  By the end of 2022 Tesla will already print twice more money per quarter than Amazon.  Tesla is at least $3T before 2025 and I believe it will be much closer to 5T",https://www.reddit.com/comments/smudbq/_/hw59fax/
